5 God stay give you guys his Spirit, an he do          15 Eh, bruddas, I goin talk bout someting

awesome stuff fo you guys wit his power.            dat everybody can undastan. If one guy

guys wen hear? 6 Jalike Abraham. He wen             um no good. 16 So, God wen promise da
trus God. Az why God wen say Abraham get            good stuffs to Abraham an his boy. He
um right wit him.                                   neva say, “an fo yoa boys,” cuz dass plenny
   7 So den, you guys gotta undastan dis: Da        peopo. He ony say, “an fo yoa boy,” cuz
peopo dat trus God, dey jalike Abrahamʼs            dass ony one guy, Christ. 17 Dis wat I
kids. 8 God wen show inside da Bible dat            mean. God wen make da deal wit Abraham
he goin make all da diffren peopos get um           long time befo, bout Christ. Den, four
right wit him, cuz dey trus God. So God             hundred an thirty years afta dat, God wen
wen tell Abraham da Good Stuff From God             give Moses da Rules. But da Rules no mo
way befo time. He say: “Cuz a you, I goin do        power fo make Godʼs promise no good. 18 If
plenny good stuffs fo all da diffren peopos         Godʼs kids can get dea share cuz dey work
all ova da world.” 9 So den, God goin do            fo um wen dey do wat Godʼs Rules say, den
plenny good stuffs fo da peopo who trus             no need God fo promise um dea share jalike
him, jalike he wen do fo Abraham, da guy            one gif. Cuz nobody work fo one gif. But
who wen trus him.                                   God wen give um to Abraham jalike one gif,
   10 Whoeva try do everyting da Rules say          jalike he wen promise.
fo get um right wit God, dey get one kahuna            19 How come get da Rules, den? God
on top dem. Cuz da Bible say, “Everybody            wen give um cuz everybody do bad kine
who no stay do everyting dat Godʼs Rules            stuff. Wen Godʼs Boy wen come, da One
say we gotta do, dey get one kahuna on              da promise talk bout, den fo get um right
top dem.” 11 Stay clear dat no mo nobody            wit God, no need da Rules no moa. Angel
dat do everyting da Rules say. Dass why             messenja guys wen give Moses da Rules, an
nobody get um right wit God da way God              den Moses wen give um to da peopo. So
see um. Cuz God wen say inside da Bible,            Moses wen stay in da middle, fo talk to both
“Da guy dat get um right wit me cuz he trus         God an da peopo. 20 Need one guy in da
