You guys stay doing bad kine stuff, an jalike you stay fooling aroun behind Godʼs back. Dass why you guys telling me you like see proof lidat. You guys no goin see notting. Da same ting jalike wen happen to da guy Jonah, dass da ony proof you guys goin see!” Den Jesus go way from dem. Wat Da Pharisee Guys An Da Sadducee Guys Jesus Feed Four Tousand Guys Teach (Mark 8:1-10) (Mark 8:14-21) 5 Jesus guys go come by him ova dea da odda side da lake. But den dey wen foget da food. Jesus tell um, “Watch out! Watch out fo da Pharisee guys an da Sadducee guys! Dey jalike da yeast dat make da bread dough mo bigga.” 7 Jesus guys talking, an trying fo figga out wat he mean.

You guys no undastan, still yet? Wen I wen broke da five breads fo da five tousand guys, how much baskets you guys wen pick up afta? Tink bout dat. Da seven breads dat wen feed four tousand guys, how much baskets you guys wen pick up afta? How come you guys no undastan dat I no talking bout food?

He aks da guys he teaching, “Eh, I da Guy Dass Fo Real, but who da peopo tink me?” 14 Dey say, “Get guys dat say you John Da Baptiza Guy. An get odda guys dat say you Elijah. Get mo odda guys dat say you Jeremiah, o one nodda guy who wen talk fo God long time ago.” 15 Jesus aks dem, “Kay den, wat bout you guys? Who you tink me fo real kine?” 16 Simon Peter say, “You da Christ Guy, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. Da God who alive fo real kine, you his Boy.” 17 Jesus say, “Eh, Johnʼs boy! Simon! You can stay good inside cuz you know dat. No mo nobody from dis world wen teach you dat. My Fadda in da sky, he wen teach you dat. I tell you, yoa name Peter, an dat mean ‘Da Rock.’ On top dis rock I goin make my church. Da power dat come from Hell fo kill peopo no goin win ova my church guys. I goin let you take charge da peopo dat get God in da sky fo dea King. If you say bout someting ova hea inside dis world ‘No can,’ den God in da sky goin say ‘No can’ too. An if you say bout someting ova hea inside dis world ‘Dass okay,’ den God in da sky goin say ‘Dass okay’ too.” 20 Den he tell his guys, “Make shua you guys no tell nobody dat I da Christ Guy, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send.” Alive 21 Jesus wen start fo show da guys he teaching how he gotta go Jerusalem an suffa plenny ova dea. All da older leada guys, da main priest guys, an da teacha guys dat teach Godʼs Rules, dey da ones dat goin make Jesus suffa, an dey da ones dat goin kill him. But he say he goin come back alive day numba three afta dey kill um. Peter take him on da side an tell him, “Eh! No way, Boss! No way dass goin happen to you!” 23 But Jesus wen turn aroun an tell Peter, “Eh, move outa my way, Devil! You ony trying fo jam me up. Cuz you tink jalike da peopo tink, not jalike God tink.” 24 Jesus tell his guys, “Whoeva like stick Wat Peter Say Bout Jesus (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21) wit me, dey gotta make up dea mind dat dey no goin be dea own boss no moa. Goin be hard, jalike dying on top one cross. An den, dey can stick wit me. If bodda you dat you goin mahke, fo shua you goin mahke. But if you like do everyting you do fo me, an no bodda you if you mahke fo dat, den you goin live fo real kine. Dis poho: one guy get everyting inside dis world, but da guy end up cut off from God, an no mo da real kine life inside. You tink you rich nuff fo buy back yoa life? I da Guy Dass Fo Real. I goin come back wit Godʼs angel messenja guys from da sky. Goin be awesome, cuz my Fadda, he awesome. Den I goin pay back everybody fo wat dey wen do, good kine o bad kine. Dass right! An I like tell you guys dis too: I da Guy Dass fo Real, an get some peopo standing ova hea, dat no goin mahke till dey see me come fo be King.” 17 Jesus Look Diffren On Top Da Mountain (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36) 1 Afta six days, Jesus wen take Peter, James, an James brudda John wit him up on top one big mountain wea neva have nobody. Den, da same time dey stay looking at him, Jesus wen start fo look diffren in front dem. His face wen shine jalike da sun, an his clotheses wen come shiny kine jalike one bright light. An you Jesus Say He Goin Mahke An Come Back know wat? Right den an dea Moses an Elijah from long time befo wen come outa (Mark 8:31-39; Luke 9:22-27) no wea, an dey stay talking wit Jesus. Den Peter tell Jesus, “You know wat, Boss? Good we stay ova hea! If you like, I goin make shacks ova hea, one fo you, one fo Moses, one fo Elijah.” 5 Peter still talking, an you know wat? Had one bright cloud go ova dem. Den, one voice from inside da cloud say, “Dis my boy! I get plenny love an aloha fo him. I feel real good inside cuz a him. Eh, listen to nuff, az why.

I Da Guy Dass Fo Real. I goin mahke, an I goin come back alive afta I mahke. Ony dat time, you guys can tell peopo wat you guys wen see.” 10 Jesus guys aks him, “Eh, da teacha guys dat teach da Rules from God, how come dey say Elijah gotta come back first befo Godʼs Spesho Guy goin show up?” 11 He say, “Dass right. Elijah gotta come back first an make everyting ready fo Godʼs Spesho Guy. But I telling you, Elijah wen come back awready, an da peopo neva know who him. Dey even wen make um any kine. An me, da Guy Dass Fo Real, same ting, dey goin make me suffa lidat too.” 13 Den his guys wen figga dat wen he talk bout Elijah coming back, he mean John Da Baptiza Guy.

He fall down an start fo shake plenny, an suffa real bad. Plenny times he fall down inside da fire o inside da water. I wen bring um ova hea by da guys you stay teaching, but dey no can make him come good.” 17 Jesus say, “You guys! Nowdays nobody stay trus God! You guys, yoa head, all kapakahi! How much time still I gotta put up wit you guys? Bring da boy ova hea!” 18 Den Jesus talk strong to da bad kine come by him, an aks him, “From all da guys spirit. Den da spirit let go da boy. Right den an dea da boy wen come good. Jesus guys go by him wen neva have nobody, an aks him, “How come we no can throw um out?” 20 He say, “Cuz you guys neva trus God too: if you guys trus God ony litto bit, jalike da smalles mustard seed, you can tell dis mountain, ‘Go move ova dea,’ an da mountain goin go. No goin get notting dat you guys no can handle. [But ony get one way fo make dis kine bad spirit let peopo go, you know. You gotta skip food so you can pray mo hard.]” One Mo Time Jesus Say He Gotta Mahke An Come Back Alive (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43b-45) 22 Den all Jesus guys wen come togedda wit him, Galilee side, an Jesus wen tell um, “I da Guy Dass Fo Real, you know. But den get peopo dat goin set me up an bus me. Dey goin kill me, an afta dat, day numba three, I goin come back alive.” Dat make Jesus guys come real sad. Jesus Pay Da Tax Fo Da Temple (Outa Egypt 30:11-16) 24 Den Jesus an his guys go Capernaum town, an da guys who take money fo tax go by Peter an say, “Yoa teacha pay da tax fo da temple, yeah?” 25 He say, “Yeah, he pay um.” Wen Peter go home, Jesus talk first, an say, “Eh Simon! Try tell me wat you tink bout dis: All da kings inside da world, from Jesus Throw Out Da Bad Kine Spirit From wea dey take da tax from? From dea own peopo, o from da odda peopos?” (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43a) 26 He say, “From da odda peopos.” Jesus say, “Den dea own peopo no need pay, yeah? But if us guys no pay um, da tax guys goin tink bad bout us guys. So, go by da lake, an drop one line inside da water. Da first fish you catch, open da mout. You goin find one silva coin inside. Take dat coin to da tax guys. Dat goin be nuff fo me an you.” 18 Who Da Numba One Guy? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48) 1 One nodda time da guys Jesus teaching dat get God in da sky fo dea King, who da numba one guy?” 2 Jesus tell one small kid fo come, an he put um in front dem. He say, “I tell you guys dis fo shua: If you guys no change an start fo tink jalike one litto kid, no way God in da sky goin be yoa King. Da guy dat no tink he gotta be numba one everytime, jalike dis small kid, dat guy goin come numba one, from dose dat get God in da sky fo dea King. Whoeva take in one small kid jalike dis one, cuz da kid stay tight wit me, same ting, dat guy take me in.” 6 Den Jesus say, “Dese small kids hea, dey trus me! If somebody try make um so dey no like trus me no moa, mo betta take one real big heavy stone from da mill, an tie um aroun da guy, den throw him inside da ocean fo drown! “Auwe! Da peopo hea inside da world, dey goin get it! Cuz get guys ova hea who try fo make odda guys do bad kine stuff! Fo shua, goin get peopo dat like make odda guys do bad kine stuff. But auwe! Da guy dat make one nodda guy do bad kine stuff, he goin get it! If yoa hand o yoa leg make you do bad kine stuff, cut um off an throw um away! Mo betta you live to da max foeva, no matta you no mo hand o leg. No good you get da hand an da leg, an dey throw you inside da fire dat stay burning foeva. If yoa eye make you do bad kine stuff, pull um out an throw um away! Mo betta you live foeva wit one eye. No good you get two eyes an dey throw you inside Hell wea get plenny fire.” 10 Jesus say, “Watch out dat you guys no tink you mo betta den one a dese small kids hea. I tell you guys, dey get spesho angel guys inside da sky dat stay wea dey can talk to my Fadda up dea, any time dey like.-13 How you guys figga wat one farma guy goin do? If he get hundred sheeps, an one sheep stay lost, he goin let da ninety-nine odda sheeps stay ova dea by demself on top da hill, an go look fo da one sheep dat stay lost, yeah? An I tell you dis too: wen he find um, he feel mo good inside fo da one sheep he wen find, den fo da ninety-nine sheeps dat neva get lost. [Me, I Da Guy Dass fo Real. I wen come fo take da guys dat stay lost outa da bad kine stuff dey doing.] 14 Dass why my Fadda in da sky no like if even one a da small kids hea stay lost.” If Yoa Brudda Do Bad Kine Stuff (Luke 17:3; John 8:17; Da Rules Second Time 19:15) 15 Jesus say, “If yoa brudda do bad ting to you, go tell him wat he wen do. But go by yoaself. If he listen, den he goin come jalike No Good, Make Peopo Do Bad Kine Stuff yoa brudda again. But if he no like listen, (Mark 9:42; Luke 17:1-2) take one o two odda guys wit you an tell him one mo time, cuz jalike da Bible wen say from befo time, ‘Fo everyting, need two o three guys fo tell wat dey wen see an hear, so you know fo shua wat wen happen.’ 17 If he no like listen to dem, den go tell all da church guys. An if he no like listen to dem, make to him jalike he from one a da peopos dat donno God, o jalike he one crooked guy dat take money fo tax. Wen You Say ‘Can’ o ‘No Can’ (Matthew 16:19) 18 “I tell you guys dis too: If you say ‘No can’ bout someting ova hea inside dis world, God in da sky goin say ‘No can’ too. An if you guys say ‘Dass okay’ bout someting ova hea inside dis world, God in da sky goin say ‘Dass okay’ too. I tell you guys one mo time, if two a you guys inside dis world pray togedda to God fo da same ting, my Fadda in da sky goin make um happen fo you guys. Cuz weaeva two o three guys come togedda cuz dey my guys, I stay right ova dea wit dem.” Da Sheep Dat Stay Lost Da Worka Guy Dat No Like Let Da Odda Guy (Luke 15:3-7) Go 21 Den Peter go by Jesus an say, “Eh, Boss, how much times my brudda can do bad tings to me, an I gotta let him go? Seven times, o wat?” 22 Jesus tell him, “No, not ony seven times, but seventy times seven.” 23 Den Jesus say, “Dass how you guys gotta make. Cuz everytime wen God in da sky stay King, dass jalike get one king dat check out wat money his worka guys owe him. He sit down, an dey bring one worka guy by him dat owe um uku paila money. But da worka guy no mo money fo pay him, so da king tell da odda worka guys, ‘Kay den. Go sell da guy fo make him one slave, an sell his wife an his kids too, an everyting he get. Dass how he goin pay wat he owe.’ 26 “But dat worka guy go down an beg um. He say, ‘Ah, Boss, try wait! Give me chance! I goin pay you back all da money!’ 27 Da king get pity fo him, so he let um go, an tell him, ‘No need pay notting.’ 28 “Den dat same worka guy go outside, an spock one nodda worka guy who owe him pay fo four month work. He grab him by da neck, an tell him, ‘Eh! You owe me money! You betta pay me back!’ 29 Da odda worka guy go down an beg um, ‘Try wait! Give me chance! I goin pay you back all da money.’ 30 “But da first worka guy no like wait, so he tell da guards fo put da odda guy inside da prison till he can pay wat he owe him. “Da odda worka guys see wat wen happen, an dey all bum out. Dey go tell da king everyting dat wen happen. Den da king tell da first worka guy fo come, an say, ‘You so unreal! You one bad worka guy! You wen beg me. I wen let you go, an tell you dat you no need pay me back notting. But how come you no pity da odda guy, jalike I wen pity you an give you chance?’ 34 Da king stay real huhu. He give da guy to da guards inside da prison fo torture him, till he pay everyting he owe.” 35 Den Jesus say fo finish, “My Fadda in da sky goin do lidat to all you guys, if you no let yoa brudda go fo real kine inside yoa heart, fo all da bad kine stuff yoa brudda wen do to you.” Rules Second Time 24:1) 1 Afta Jesus pau teaching, he go way from Galilee side, an go wea da Judea side start, da odda side a da Jordan River. Had plenny peopo wen go by him, an he wen make da sick guys come good ova dea. Had some Pharisee guys dat wen go by Jesus fo try trap him from wat he goin tell um. Dey aks him, “Inside Godʼs Rules, az 20:12-16; Da Rules Second Time 5:16-20) right, o wat, fo one guy go throw out his wife fo jus anyting?” 4 He say, “You guys neva read inside da Bible, dat wen God wen make da world, he make one guy, den he make one wahine. An God say, ‘Cuz I wen do dat, da guy no goin stay wit his mudda an fadda no moa, he goin stay wit his wife, an da guy an da wahine goin be jalike one body.’ 6 So dey not two peopo no moa, dey one body. Wat God wen put togedda, da peopo betta not broke um up.” 7 Dey aks him, “Den how come Moses wen tell, ‘Fo get one divorce, gotta give da wife one paper, den let her go’?” 8 Jesus tell dem, “Cuz all you guys so hard head, dass why Moses wen let you guys throw out yoa wife. But I telling you guys dis: Wen God wen make da world, dat time no was lidat. An I tell you guys dis too: If one wahine neva go fool aroun, an her husban still yet go throw her out, an den he marry one nodda wahine, da first one still yet stay his wife. Da guy ony fooling aroun da second wahine.” 10 Jesus guys say, “Eh, if dass how stay, mo betta no marry.” 11 But Jesus say, “Everybody no can han- dle dis, ony da guys God help fo do um, dey can handle. Cuz get guys dat no can marry cuz dey born lidat. An get odda guys dat no can marry cuz peopo wen make um lidat. An get mo odda guys dat no marry cuz dey like ony work fo God, da King inside da sky. Whoeva can handle dis, let him do um.” Jesus Pray Fo Da Small Kids (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17) 13 Da peopo wen bring dea small kids by Jesus, cuz dey like him fo put his hands on 19 top dea heads an pray. Den Jesus guys wen No Throw Out Yoa Wife scold um. But den Jesus wen say, “Let (Mark 10:1-12; Da Start 1:27; 2:24; 5:2; Da da kids come! No stop dem! Cuz da peopo who get God in da sky fo dea King, inside demself dey jus like dese kids.” 15 Den Jesus wen put his hands on top da kids heads, an afta dat, he wen go way. Da Young Guy Dat Get Plenny Stuff [Kanaka Waiwai] (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30; Outa Egypt 16 An you know wat? One guy go by Jesus, an say, “Eh, Teacha! Can aks you one question? Wat good ting I gotta do fo live to da max foeva?” 17 Jesus say, “How come you aks me bout da ‘good ting’? Ony get one Guy dat stay good fo real kine, dass God. If you like live to da max foeva, you know Godʼs Rules. Go do um, den.” 18 Da guy say, “Wat rules?” Jesus say, “No go kill nobody, no go fool aroun behind da oddaʼs back, no rip off nobody, no bulai any kine bout nobody, 19 show respeck fo yoa mudda an fadda, get love fo da odda guy jalike you get love fo yoaself.” 20 Da young guy say, “Ho, Teacha!

An garans you goin get da real kine rich stuff in da sky.” 22 Da young guy wen hear dat, an he wen come real sad, so dat he wen go way, cuz he get plenny rich stuffs dat he neva like sell. So, Jesus tell his guys, “You see dat? I tell you guys dis too, az why hard fo one rich guy fo get God in da sky fo his King. I telling you guys one mo time, stay mo easy fo one camel go thru da puka inside one needle, den fo one rich guy fo get God in da sky fo his King.” 25 His guys wen hear dat. Wen blow dea minds, an dey say, “Eh, if dass how stay, den who can get outa da bad kine stuff he stay inside?” 26 Jesus look strait at dem, an tell, “No mo nobody dat can do um, but ony God, he da one dat can do um.” 27 Den Peter wen tell, “Eh, Boss, try listen!

If dis stone fall down on top one guy, da stone goin make him jalike dust.”] 45 Wen da main priest guys an da Phar- Da Guys Dat Rent One Grape Farm isee guys hear da stories, dey know Jesus (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19; Isaiah 5:1-2; was talking bout dem. An dey like grab him fo put him inside prison. But dey scared da peopo, cuz da peopo wen tink he one guy who talk fo God. Da Wedding Lu‛au Story (Luke 14:15-24) 1 One mo time Jesus tell da peopo mo stories fo teach um. He tell um lidis: “Wen God in da sky stay King, dass jalike one king who make one lu‛au cuz his boy goin get married. Wen da time come, he send his worka guys fo tell all da peopo he wen aks fo come, fo come awready. But his friends neva like come. “So den he send some mo odda workas. He tell um, ‘Tell all da peopo I wen aks fo come, “Time awready! I wen kill da cows an da bestes kine baby cows. I wen make all da food ready. Try come!” ’ 5 “But da peopo he wen tell fo come, dey no care, an dey go way from da guy. Some guys go back to dea farms, an odda guys go back dea stores fo do dea own business. Had odda guys dat wen grab da worka guys, an dey make any kine to da worka guys, an dey even wen kill da worka guys. “An den da king wen come so wild wit dem, he wen send his army guys, fo kill da guys who wen kill his workas, an den da army guys wen burn up da whole town. Den da king tell his odda worka guys, ‘You know, da lu‛au fo my boy stay ready now, but da guys I wen tell fo come, dey not good nuff. So den I tell you guys, go all da main roads, an tell all da peopo you guys see ova dea fo come da wedding lu‛au.’ 10 So da worka guys wen go check out all da roads, an wen bring all da guys dey wen find ova dea fo da lu‛au. Had choke peopo, da good kine guys, an da bad kine guys. “Da king wen go inside fo look da peopo dat wen come ova dea, an he wen spock one guy who neva have wedding kine clotheses. He tell da guy, ‘Eh, how come you wen come inside hea, but you no mo wedding kine clotheses on?’ An da guy neva have notting fo say. So da king tell his worka guys, ‘Eh, tie up dis guyʼs hands an feet, an throw um outside inside da dark. Ova dea goin get peopo dat goin cry real hard an grind dea teet cuz dey so huhu an futless.’ 14 I tell you, God da King tell plenny guys fo come, but ony goin get litto bit guys he goin pick fo be his own guys.” 15 Den da Pharisee guys wen start talking togedda how dey goin catch Jesus from wat he goin tell um. So den dey wen send da guys dey teaching fo go by him, an some King Herod guys too. Dey say, “Eh, Teacha, we know you tell da trut, an you teach da true kine stuff bout wat God like everybody fo do, no matta wat da peopo tink o who dem. So, wat? Godʼs Rules say, az right fo pay King Cesar da tax money, o wat?” 18 But Jesus know dey trying fo make um any kine, an he say, “You guys, you say one ting an do one nodda! How come you guys trying fo make me say any kine? Show me da kine coin fo da tax.” An dey wen show him. Jesus say, “Who dis guy on top da coin? An wass his name?” 21 Dey say, “Dass King Cesar.” An he tell um, “Kay den, give um to Cesar, wat his, an give to God, wat his!” 22 Wen dey hear dat, wen blow dea minds, an dey wen go way from dea. Dey Aks If Peopo Goin Come Back Alive Again (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40; Da Rules Second Time 25:5; Da Start 38:8; Outa Egypt 3:6,15,16) 23 Dat same day had some Sadducee guys dat wen go by Jesus. Dis how dey teach: If you mahke, you mahke, you no goin come back alive again. So dey aks him, “Eh, Teacha! Da guy Moses who wen give us Godʼs Rules, he wen say, ‘Wen one guy mahke an he no mo kids, his brudda gotta marry da wife, an make kids fo carry da name fo da brudda who wen mahke.’ 25 “Now den, had seven bruddas ova hea by us. Da oldes brudda wen marry one wahine, den wen mahke, but neva have kids. (Dat mean da wahine goin be his nex bruddaʼs wife.) 26 Da nex brudda wen marry her, an den he wen mahke, an neva have kids. Da same ting wen happen to da nex brudda. An dis same ting wen happen wit all da odda bruddas. An all dem guys neva have kids notting. Den afta dat, da wahine wen mahke too. “So, wen da time come wen all da peopo dat wen mahke come back alive, den who goin be her husban? Cuz dey all wen marry her.” Da Tax Money Fo King Cesar 29 Jesus tell um, “Eh, you guys all jam up, (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26) you know. Cuz you donno wat da Bible say from befo time, az why, an you donno Godʼs power. Wen da guys dat wen mahke come back alive again, dey goin be jalike da angel messenja guys in da sky; dat time dey no marry. Wot! You guys neva read inside da Bible wat God wen tell you bout da guys who goin come back alive afta dey mahke? God say, ‘I da God dat fo Abraham, an fo Isaac, an fo Jacob.’ So I telling you guys, he not da God fo da mahke guys dat no mo spirit inside dem. He da God fo da guys like Abraham an Isaac an Jacob, dat get one spirit inside dem dat stay alive, no matta dea body wen mahke.” an wen blow dea minds. Second Time 6:5; Da Prieses 19:18) he wen shut up da Sadducee guys, den all a dem wen go by Jesus. One teacha who teach Godʼs Rules wen aks him one question fo try catch um. He say, “Eh, Teacha, from all da Rules God wen give us, which one da main one?” da Boss yoa God, wit all yoa heart, an wit everyting inside you, an wit how you tink. Dis da first an mos importan Rule God wen give us. An da nex Rule jalike dat one: ‘Get love an aloha fo da odda guy jalike you get love an aloha fo yoaself.’ 40 All Godʼs Rules, an everyting da guys who wen talk fo God wen say, come from dese two Rules.” Him?:1) togedda by Jesus, an Jesus aks um, 42 “Wat you guys tink? Da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, whose boy him?” wen tell King David fo call Godʼs Spesho Guy ‘Boss’? Cuz David wen say, 44 ‘Da Boss, “Come ova hea, sit down! Bumbye I goin make da peopo dat go agains 45 “Kay den. David call Godʼs Spesho Guy ‘Boss,’ yeah? Den how he can be Davidʼs boy, same time?” 46 An da Pharisee guys neva have notting fo say. From dat time, everybody scared fo aks him odda ques- tions. Da Guys Dat Teach Godʼs Rules An Da Pharisee Guys (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47) 33 All da peopo wen hear him teach dat, 1 Afta dat Jesus tell all da peopo an da guys he teaching, 2 “Da teachas who teach Da Main Rule Godʼs Rules, an da Pharisee guys, dey get (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28; Da Rules da same job jalike Moses had, cuz dey tell everybody wat fo do. So you guys betta 34 Wen da Pharisee guys wen hear dat do everyting dey tell you guys. But no do jalike dey do. Cuz dey no do da same ting dat dey teach. Wat dey teach, jalike dey stay pile up big heavy kine stuffs on top peopoʼs shouldas, dat real hard fo carry. But dey even no like help da peopo wit dea small finga notting. Everyting dey do, dey 37 Jesus tell um, “Get love an aloha fo ony do um so dey can make demself look good in front da peopo. Dey go aroun an show off stuff da Bible say on top dea heads an arms, an make um look real nice wit real fancy kine religious kine clotheses. Dey like sit inside da main place at da lu‛au, an on top da main place inside da Jewish churches. Dey like da peopo fo talk to dem wit respeck inside da open market, an fo call um ‘Teacha.’ 8 “But you guys, no let da peopo call you Da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, Whose Boy guys ‘Teacha.’ Cuz you guys get ony one (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44; Songs fo God Teacha, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, an you guys stay brudda-brudda. No call 41 Dat time too, da Pharisee guys come nobody inside da world yoa ‘Fadda,’ cuz you guys get ony one Fadda, an he stay in da sky. No let dem call you ‘Boss,’ cuz you guys get ony one Boss. Dass me, Dey say, “He from King Davidʼs ohana.” da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. Wit you 43 Jesus say, “Den how come Godʼs Spirit guys, whoeva yoa leada, he goin help all da odda guys jalike he one worka. Whoeva make himself big, God goin make um small. An whoeva make himself small, God goin He tell my Boss, make him big.” Da Guys Dat Say One Ting An Do Anodda Dis da importan place by my right 13 Den Jesus say, “Auwe! side. You teacha guys who teach Godʼs Rules an you Pharisee you guys, you guys goin get it! You guys say Go down in front you, one ting an do anodda. You guys shut da Fo show dat you da winna ova dem.” ’ door so da peopo no can get God in da sky fo dea King. But you guys no like get him fo yoa King too. An you guys no let da peopo who like get God fo dea King, get um. “Auwe! You teacha guys who teach Godʼs Rules an you Pharisee guys, you guys goin get it! You guys say one ting an do anodda. You guys no mo shame fo trick da widows an take away dea house, an same time you guys praying, saying plenny stuff, so nobody tink you guys ripping off da widows.

But afta he come one Jew, you guys make him two times mo worse den you guys, so he going Hell jalike you guys. “Auwe! You guys goin get it! You guys no can see notting, but you guys try fo show da odda guys wea fo go. You guys say, ‘If one guy swear to God he goin do someting, an he say, “I swear by da temple,” he no need do wat he say. But if he cup an plate inside first, den da outside swear to God an he say, “I swear by da gold inside da temple,” he gotta do um.’ 17 Wot! You guys not tinking! You guys no can see notting! You guys tink da gold inside da temple mo importan den da temple dat make da gold spesho fo God? No way! “An you guys say, ‘Whoeva swear to God dat he goin do someting, an he say, “I swear by da altar inside da temple,” he no need do wat he say. But whoeva swear to God, an he say, “I swear by da gif offering on top da altar,” dat guy gotta do um.’ 19 Wot! You guys not tinking! You guys no can see notting! You guys tink da gif offering on top da altar mo importan den da altar dat make da gif offering spesho fo God? No way! “Whoeva swear to God an say, ‘I swear by da altar,’ he swear to God by all da gifs on top da altar too. Whoeva swear to God an say, ‘I swear by da temple,’ he swear by da God dat stay inside da temple. Whoeva swear to God an say, ‘I swear by da sky,’ dass Godʼs throne, an God stay sit ova dea. So, if he swear to God ‘by da sky,’ you guys show dat you jalike dem killa guys den he swear by God. “Auwe! You teacha guys who teach Godʼs Rules an you Pharisee guys, you guys goin get it! You guys say one ting an do anodda. You guys give God ten percent from da spice, like da mint, da dill kine spice, an da cummin spice. But you guys no do da main stuff Godʼs Rules say.

You guys make big tombs fo da guys who wen talk fo God, an fix up da tombs fo da guys who wen everytime do da right ting. Same time, you guys say, ‘If we was dea wen our ancesta guys was living, we neva help dem kill da guys who wen talk fo God.’ 31 Wen you guys say dat, -- you guys dea kids!

But you goin kill some a da guys, an some guys you guys goin kill on top crosses, an mo odda guys you guys goin whip hard inside da Jewish churches, an you guys goin make um suffa from one town to anodda town. God goin punish you guys fo all da guys yoa ancesta guys wen kill. Dey wen kill any kine guys who wen everytime do wat dey suppose to, starting from Abel all da way to Zekariah, he Barakiahʼs boy.

Jesus Go Inside Jerusalem Jalike One King (Matthew 21:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12- 19; Songs fo God 118:25-26) 1 Den Jesus dem come near Jerusalem an come by Betpage an Betany, on top Olive Ridge.

Dey bring da Jesus Make Bartimeus So He Can See young donkey by Jesus. Dey throw dea (Matthew 20:29-34; Luke 18:35-43) coats on top um, an Jesus wen sit on top um. Plenny peopo put dea coats down on top da road too, jalike fo one king. Odda guys cut branches from da palm trees in da fields, an put um down on top da road fo show respeck fo him. An plenny peopo stay walking in front an behind, yelling “Hui! God goin take us outa da bad kine stuff we stay in! God goin do plenny good kine stuff fo him. Dis da guy who come fo da Boss Up Dea! God goin do good kine stuff fo us! He goin give us one King jalike King David, Our ancesta guy! God in da sky, 11 Den Jesus go inside Jerusalem, an go inside da temple yard. He look aroun at everyting. But late awready, dass why he go back Betany wit his twelve guys. Da nex day, wen dey go way from Betany fo go Jerusalem one mo time, Jesus wen come real hungry. He spock one fig tree wit leafs, but kinda far. He go ova dea fo check out if get fruit. He come dea an find ony leafs, cuz not time yet fo fruit. So he tell da fig tree, “Nobody goin eat fruit from you no moa!” His guys wen hear wat he say.) 15 Dey get to Jerusalem. Jesus wen go inside da temple yard, an he start fo throw out all da guys who was buying an selling stuff ova dea. He wen huli da tables wea dey sell da spesho kine temple money fo give to da temple, an da benches fo da guys who sell doves fo sacrifice. He no let nobody carry any kine stuff thru da temple yard. He teach um, “Da Bible say, ‘My temple goin be one house fo all da peopos all ova da world fo pray inside.’ But you guys stay make um jalike one hangout fo crooks!” 18 But da main priest guys an da teachas who teach Godʼs Rules hear dat. Dey try figga out how dey can kill him. Dey scared a him, cuz da tings he teach, blow da peopoʼs minds. Wen da sun go down, Jesus dem go outside da town. Early da nex morning dey pass by da fig tree, an see um all dry up from da root. Peter rememba, an tell Jesus, “Eh, Teacha! Look da kine! You wen put kahuna da fig tree, an now, all dry up!” 22 Jesus tell um, “Gotta trus God! Az right! I like tell you guys dis too: You goin tell dis mountain ova hea, ‘Eh, get up! Throw yoaself inside da ocean.’ If you trus God fo make dat happen, an no trus um ony litto bit same time, den goin be He goin take us outa da bad kine stuff lidat. Dass why I tell you guys, wen you we stay in!” pray, everyting you aks God fo do, trus him jalike you get um awready, an dat goin be. Everytime you guys stand up an pray, if you huhu wit somebody, you gotta let dem go, an no feel huhu wit dem. If you do dat, Da Fig Tree Dat No Mo Fruit den yoa Fadda dat stay inside da sky, he (Matthew 21:18-19) goin let you guys go, an no feel huhu bout da bad kine stuff you guys wen do. [But if you guys no like let da odda guy go, an like stay huhu wit dem, den yoa Fadda in da sky, he no goin let you guys go, he goin stay huhu bout all da bad kine stuff you guys wen do.]” Wat Right Jesus Get Fo Do Wat He Do? (Matthew 21:23-27; Luke 20:1-8) 27 Jesus dem come back Jerusalem. He Jesus Inside Da Temple Yard walk inside da temple yard, an da main (Matthew 21:12-17; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13- priest guys, da teachas who teach Godʼs Rules, an da older leada guys wen go by him. Dey aks him, “Eh, wat right you get fo do dis kine stuff? Who wen say you can do um?” 29 Jesus tell um, “I like aks you guys one ting. You tell me, an den I tell you guys wat right I get fo do dis kine stuff. Da guy John, wen he wen baptize, wea he wen get da right? God in da sky, he give um da right? O da peopo, dey give um da right? Try tell me dat.” 31 Dey talking to demself. Dey say, “If we tell him, ‘God in da sky give um da right,’ he goin say, ‘How come you guys neva believe him den?’ 32 But if we say, ‘Da peopo give um da right,’ no way! You know, us guys scared wat da peopo goin do, cuz everybody tink dat John wen talk fo God.” 33 So dey tell him, “Eh, we donno.” Den Jesus say, “Kay den, I no goin tell Jesus Teach Um Bout Da Fig Tree you guys from wea I get da right.” (Matthew 21:20-22) 12 Da Guys Dat Rent One Grape Field (Matthew 21:33-46; Luke 20:9-1; Songs fo God 118:22-23; Isaiah 5:1-2) 1 Jesus start teaching um wit stories. He say, “One guy wen go plant one grape field. He make one fence aroun um, an dig one puka inside da groun fo squeeze da grapes. An he build one watch tower. Den he wen rent da grape farm to some farma guys, an den he go far away. “Wen time fo cut da grapes, he send one worka guy fo get his share from da farma guys grapes. But da farma guys wen grab da worka guy, an bus um up, an throw him outside wit notting. Da boss send one nodda worka. Dey bus up his head an dey no shame fo make any kine to him. So he send one nodda worka, an dey kill um. He send plenny odda guys. Some a dem dey bus up, but da oddas, dey kill um. “Still yet had one guy dea, but was his boy. He really love dat boy. In da end he wen send him. He say, ‘Eh, dey goin show respeck fo my boy.’ 7 But wen da farma guys spock da boy, dey tell each odda, ‘Eh, dis da guy goin own da farm. Come, we kill him an take ova da grape farm.’ 8 So dey grab da boy an kill him, an throw him outside da grape field. “Kay den, wen da boss who own da grape farm come, wat you guys tink he goin do to dem? He goin kill da bad guys, an den he goin rent da farm to some odda guys. Eh, you guys neva read inside da Bible bout da stone dass jalike me? Da Bible say, “Had one big stone, Da builda guys was tinking, But dat stone, 11 Da Boss Up Dea 12 Den da main priest dem was tinking how dey can bus him, cuz dey know he was talking bout dem. But dey scared da peopo. So dey go way from him. Lata dey send some Pharisee guys an some King Herod guys fo try trick Jesus in wat he say. Dey come an say, “Eh, Teacha, we know you fo real, no matta wat da peopo tink o who dem. An you tell da trut wen you teach Godʼs way. So, wat? Dass right fo pay King Cesar da tax money, o wat?” 15 But Jesus know dey say one ting an tink anodda, an he say, “How come you Second Time 6:4-5,35; Joshua 22:5; Da Prieses guys like trick me? Show me da kine coin 19:18; Isaiah 45:21) fo da tax so I can look at um.” 16 An dey wen show him. He say, “Who dis guy on top da coin? An wass his name?” Dey say, “Dass King Cesar.” 17 An he tell um, “Kay den. Give um to Cesar, wat his, an give to God, wat his!” Wen dey hear dat, wen blow dea minds. Dey Aks If We Goin Come Back Alive (Matthew 22:23-33; Luke 20:27-40; Da Start 38:8; Da Rules Second Time 25:5; Outa Egypt 3:6,15,16) 18 Den some Sadducee guys go by Jesus. Dis how dey teach: If you mahke, you mahke, you no goin come back alive again. So dey aks him, 19 “Eh, Teacha! Da guy Moses who wen give us Godʼs Rules, he wen say, ‘Wen one guy mahke an he no mo kids, his brudda gotta marry his wife, an make kids fo carry da name fo da brudda who wen mahke.’ 20 Now den, had seven bruddas ova hea by us guys. Da first one wen marry one wahine, den he wen mahke, but neva have kids. Da nex brudda wen marry da bruddaʼs wife, an den he wen mahke, an neva have kids. Da same ting wen happen to da nex brudda. An dis ting wen happen to all da seven bruddas. ‘Poho! Dis stone junk!’ An all dem guys neva have kids notting. An An dey no take um. den afta dat, da wahine wen mahke too. “So, wen da time come wen all da Dass da corner block. peopo dat wen mahke come back alive, Can make da building strong. who goin be her husban? Cuz dey all wen marry her.” Wen do dis, yeah? Jesus tell um, “You guys all jam up, you An dis awesome!” know. Cuz you guys donno wat da Bible say from befo time, az why, an you guys donno Godʼs power. Wen da peopo dat wen mahke come back alive again, dat time dey no marry. Dey goin be jalike da angel Da Tax Money Fo King Cesar messenja guys in da sky. But da guys who (Matthew 22:15-22; Luke 20:20-26) wen mahke, dey goin come back alive. You guys neva read inside da Bible wat Moses wen write bout da burning bush? God say, ‘I da God fo Abraham, an fo Isaac, an fo Jacob.’ 27 He not da God fo da mahke peopo. He da God fo da peopo dat get one spirit inside dem dat stay alive. Dass why you guys wrong!” Da Main Rule (Matthew 22:34-40; Luke 10:25-28; Da Rules 28 One teacha who teach Godʼs Rules was standing dea. He hear dem talking, an he know dat Jesus wen shut up da Sadducee guys. So he aks him, “Eh, from all da Rules God wen give us, wat da main Rule?” 29 Jesus tell him, “Da main Rule dis: ‘Listen, all you Israel peopo! Da Boss Up Dea, he our God, an he da one an ony Boss. Get love an aloha fo da Boss yoa God, wit all yoa heart, an wit everyting inside you, an wit how you tink, an wit all yoa power.’ 31 An da nex main Rule jalike dis one, ‘Get love an aloha fo da odda guy jalike you get love an aloha fo yoaself.’ No mo odda Rule, mo importan den dis two Rules.” 32 Da teacha who teach Godʼs Rules tell um, “Eh, Teacha, right on! Dass right wat you say, ‘God, he one God, an no mo odda God, ony him.’ 33 Us guys gotta get love an aloha fo him wit all our heart, an wit how we tink, an wit all our power. An we gotta get love an aloha fo da odda guy jalike we get love an aloha fo ourself. Dass mo importan den make da burn kine offering an da sacrifice.” 34 Jesus know dat da guy was tinking good wen he say dat. He tell him, “You stay near God, fo get him fo yoa King.” From dat time, everybody scared fo aks Jesus odda stuff. Da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, Whose Boy Him? (Matthew 22:41-46; Luke 20:41-44; Songs fo God 110:1) 35 Jesus was teaching inside da temple yard. He say, “How come da teachas dat teach Godʼs Rules say, ‘Da Spesho Guy God Goin Send, he goin come from King Davidʼs ohana’? You know, Godʼs Spirit wen tell King David fo say dis: “Da Boss Up Dea, ‘Come ova hea, sit down! Bumbye I goin make da peopo dat go agains 37 “Kay den. David call Godʼs Spesho Guy ‘Boss,’ yeah? Den how he can be Davidʼs boy, same time?” All da peopo wen hear him, an dey feel good inside. Da Teachas Dat Teach Godʼs Rules (Matthew 23:1-36; Luke 20:45-47) 38 Wen he was teaching, he say, “Watch out fo da teachas who teach Godʼs Rules! Dey like wear rich kine clotheses. Dey like da peopo talk to dem wit respeck inside da open market. Dey like sit in da main place in da Jewish churches, an in da bestes place at da lu‛aus. Dey no mo shame fo trick da widows an take away dea house, an same time dey praying, saying plenny stuff, so nobody tink dey ripping off da widows. God goin punish dem mo den da odda peopo.” Wat One Widow Wen Give God (Luke 21:1-4) 41 Jesus go sit down da odda side by da place wea da peopo give money fo da temple. He watch da peopo. Plenny rich guys throw in plenny money. Den one widow dat no mo notting put in two small copper coins dat make one penny. Jesus tell his guys fo come. He say, “Dass good! An I like tell you guys dis too: Dis widow da no mo notting wen put in mo plenny fo da temple den all da odda peopo. All da odda peopo wen give dea money from plenny money dey get. But she no mo notting, an she wen give everyting she get fo stay alive.” 13 Jesus Say Dey Goin Bus Up Da Temple (Matthew 24:1-2; Luke 21:5-6) 1 Jesus was goin outside da temple yard, an one guy he teaching say, “Eh, Teacha, check out dese buildings, da stone blocks! Awesome, yeah?” 2 Jesus say, “You see all dese awesome buildings? Bumbye no goin get one stone on top da odda ova hea. Dey goin throw um He tell my Boss, all down.” Dis da importan place by my right Goin Get Trouble An Suffa side. (Matthew 24:3-14; Luke 21:7-19) 3 Lata on, Jesus go Olive Ridge, an sit you down ova dea wea can see da temple da Go down in front you, odda side da valley. Peter, James, John, an Fo show dat you da winna ova dem.’ ” Andrew come by him wen no mo odda guys dea. Dey aks him, 4 “Wat time all dat kine stuff goin happen? How we goin know wen da time come?” 5 Jesus tell um, “Watch out! No let nobody fool you guys! Plenny guys goin show up an use my name. Dey goin say, ‘Eh, me, I dat Spesho Christ Guy from God!’ An dey goin fool plenny peopo lidat. No get all shook up. You guys goin hear, ‘Dey fighting, an get war all ova da place.’ Dat gotta happen, but dat no goin mean everyting goin pau yet. One country goin fight one nodda country. One king goin fight one nodda king. Plenny diffren places, da groun goin shake hard plenny. Plenny peopo goin get notting fo eat. Dey goin suffa plenny, but all dat ony fo start. Watch out! Dey goin take you guys to dea leadas. Dey goin punish you guys wit whips inside da Jewish churches. You guys goin stand in front da governas an kings, cuz you my guys. An you goin tell um bout me. But befo dis stuff happen, all da diffren peopos all ova da world gotta hear da Good Stuff From God. Every time dey bus you guys, an take you in front da judge, no worry wat you goin say. Ony say wat da Spirit tell you right den. Dat time goin be Godʼs Spesho Spirit talking, not you. Bruddas goin sell out dea bruddas fo mahke, an da faddas goin sell out dea kids. Kids goin fight dea mudda an fadda, an set um up fo mahke. Everybody goin hate you cuz you my guys. But da guy dat hang in dea to da end, he goin come out okay.:27; 11:31; 12:11) 14 “Someting goin happen dat God hate plenny. Da bad ting goin stand wea not suppose to. Dat ting so bad, goin make everybody go way. (Whoeva read dis, dey gotta figga um out.) You know, wen you guys see dat happen, if you stay Judea side, run to da mountains. If you stay on top one house dat get flat roof, no go inside fo take yoa stuffs wit you. If you stay inside da fields, no go home fo get yoa clotheses. “Dat time goin get hard time fo da hapai wahines an da muddas dat stay nurs- ing dea babies! Aks God fo no let dis stuff happen winta time. Cuz dat time everybody goin suffa to da max. Neva have notting lidat eva wen happen befo, not even from wen God wen make da world till now, an no goin get notting lidat eva goin happen again. If da Boss Up Dea neva make dat time mo short, nobody goin come out okay. But fo help da peopo da Boss wen pick, he goin make dat trouble mo short. “Dat time, if get one guy dat tell you guys, ‘Eh, look! Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, he stay ova hea!

But da good guy who get da smarts from God, da tings he do, goin make proof dat he right.” Jesus Go Eat One Pharisee Guy House 36 One Pharisee guy wen aks Jesus fo come his house fo eat. So Jesus wen go ova dea an wen sit down by da table. Had one wahine from dat town dat wen do bad stuff an wen fool aroun. She wen hear dat Jesus stay sitting inside da Pharisee guyʼs house, an she bring one bottle made from da alabaster kine stone, full wit perfume. She wen stand behind Jesus by his feet. She stay crying, an her tears wen make his feet wet. Den she wen wipe his feet wit her hair, kiss um, an wen pour da perfume on top dem. Wen da Pharisee guy dat wen aks him fo come wen see dat, he wen tink, “Eh, if dis guy was one guy dat talk fo God fo real kine, den he know wat kine wahine stay touching him, dat she one wahine dat do bad kine stuff.” 40 Jesus wen tell him, “Simon, I like tell you someting.” Simon say, “Yeah, Teacha?

So da guy wen tell, ‘Dass okay. Foget um.’ Which guy you tink goin get mo plenny love an aloha fo him?” 43 Simon say, “I tink da guy dat wen owe him moa.” Jesus say, “Right on.” 44 Den Jesus wen turn aroun to da wahine, an tell Simon, “You see dis wahine? I wen come inside yoa house, an you neva give me water fo wash my feet. But she wen wash um wit her tears, an wen wipe um wit her hair. You neva say ‘Aloha’ an give me one kiss, but wen I wen come inside yoa house, dis wahine no pau kiss my feet. You neva give me olive oil fo my head fo show me respeck, but she wen cover my feet wit da perfume. Az why I tell you, she wen do plenny bad kine stuff, but God wen let her go awready an hemo her shame fo all dat. An how come he wen do dat? Cuz she get plenny love an aloha fo God now, az why. Da guy dat wen do litto bit bad stuff, an God wen hemo his shame fo dat, he ony goin get litto bit love an aloha fo God.” 48 Den Jesus tell da wahine, “God wen hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff you wen do.” 49 An da odda guys sitting ova dea wen start fo talk to each odda, “Who dis guy dat even hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff?” 50 Jesus tell da wahine, “Cuz you wen trus me, God wen take you outa da bad kine stuff you stay in.

He say, “You wen hear da story bout da farma guy? He wen go plant seed. He throw da seeds all ova da groun fo plant. Some seeds fall down by da side da trail. Da peopo wen walk on top um, an da birds wen go eat um up. Some seeds fall down on top da rocks, an grow, an den dry up, cuz no mo water inside da dirt. Odda seeds wen fall down inside da kine bushes wit kuku. Da seeds an da bushes grow up togedda, an da bushes wit kuku choke um. Odda seeds, dey fall down inside da good dirt, an dey wen grow good, an come up plenny, one hundred times mo den da farma wen plant.” Afta dat Jesus say, “If you guys hear dis, den tink bout um!” How Come Jesus Teach Wit Stories? (Matthew 13:10-17; Mark 4:10-12; Isaiah 6:9- 10) 9 Da guys Jesus teach wen aks him, “Wat dis story mean?” 10 He tell, “God let you guys know all da stuff bout how he stay King. But I teach da odda peopo wit stories, so jalike da Bible say, ‘dey see, but dey no can see fo real kine. Dey hear, but dey no can hear fo real kine.’ ” Jesus Tell Wat Da Story Mean (Matthew 13:18-23; Mark 4:13-26) 11 Den Jesus tell, “Dis wat da story mean. Da seed, dass wat God say. Da seeds dat fall down on top da trail, dass jalike da peopo dat hear. But da Devil come take away wat God say from inside dea heart, so dey no can trus God. Dass why God no can take um outa da bad kine stuff dey do. Da seeds on top da rocks, dass da peopo dat take wat God say, an dey stay good inside wen dey hear um. Dey trus God litto bit, but wen get hard time dey pau trus, cuz dey no mo root, jalike da seeds on top da rocks. Da seeds dat fall down inside da bushes wit kuku, dass da peopo dat hear, but den dey worry plenny, an dey like come rich an get plenny stuffs, an dey like play aroun all Even da wind an da waves do wat he tell da time. All dat stuff grab um, an choke um. Dey no rememba wat God say, jalike da seeds dat no mo wheat cuz dey stay inside da bushes wit kuku. But ho! Da seeds dat fall down inside da good dirt, dass jalike da peopo dat hear an rememba wat God say. Dey get good heart, do da right ting, an no give up. Dey jalike da seeds dat give good kine wheat.” 16 “You no light one lamp an cover um wit one bucket, o put um unda da bed. No way! You goin put um on top one shelf so da guys dat come inside dea can see da light. Cuz everyting dat stay hiding, bumbye God goin show um, an everyting dass hard fo undastan he goin make um clear, so da peopo can undastan. Tink! You gotta listen good! Da guy dat listen good goin undastan plenny, but da guy dat no listen good, God goin take away everyting he tink he know.” 19 Dat time Jesus mudda an bruddas wen come fo see him, but dey no can come near him cuz get choke plenny peopo ova dea. One guy tell Jesus, “Eh, yoa mudda an yoa bruddas, dey outside, an dey like talk to you.” 21 Jesus tell da guy, “My mudda an my bruddas? Da peopo dat hear wat God say an do um, dey da ones az my mudda an bruddas fo real.” 22 One time Jesus wen tell his guys, “We go da odda side da lake.” So dey go inside da boat an wen start fo go. Wen dey stay sailing, Jesus wen sleep. One big wind storm wen come down on top da lake, an da waves was bussing ova da boat, so da boat almos wen huli. Dey was in bad shape. Da guys wen go wake Jesus up, an say, “Eh, Boss! We goin mahke!” Jesus get up. He scold da wind an da big waves. Da storm wen pau, an everyting come nice. He tell his guys, “How come you guys no trus me?” Dey come real scared. Dat blow dea minds. Dey tell each odda, “Eh, who dis? um!” Jesus Make One Guy Wit Bad Kine Spirits Come Good (Matthew 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20) 26 Dey wen sail da odda side da lake from Galilee, wea da Gerasa town peopo get dea fields. Jesus wen go on top da beach. One guy from dat town wen come dat get some bad kine spirits in charge a him. Long time Da Lamp Unda Da Bucket dat guy neva wear clotheses o stay inside (Matthew 5:15; Mark 4:21-25) one house, but he stay inside da caves wea dey put da mahke guys.-29 Plenny times befo, one bad spirit wen grab um. No matta if da guy had chains on his hands an feet, an one nodda guy wen watch um real good, he still wen broke da chains. An da bad spirit wen make da guy go odda places wea nobody stay. So wen da spirit spock Jesus, da guy yell, an fall down by Jesus feet. Jesus tell da bad spirit, “Let go da guy!” Da spirit yell, “Eh, wat you like do to me, Jesus? Da God Dass Mo Importan Den All Da Odda Gods, I know you his Boy! I beg you, Jesus Mudda An Bruddas no hurt me!” 30 Jesus aks da guy, “Wat yoa name?” (Matthew 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35) He tell, “My name ‘Army.’ ” He say dat cuz uku paila bad kine spirits wen take ova him. Da bad kine spirits, dey beg Jesus plenny times fo no make um go suffa inside da Devilʼs Deep Dark Hole. Had plenny pigs dat stay grinding on top da hill. Da bad kine spirits wen beg Jesus, “If you go make us let da guy, we like go take ova da pigs, yeah?” Jesus Make Da Storm Pau Jesus tell um, “Go!” 33 So da bad kine (Matthew 8:23-27; Mark 4:35-41) spirits wen let go da guy, an go take ova da pigs. An den all da pigs wen run down one steep hill, an fall inside da lake, an drown. Wen da guys taking care da pigs wen see wat wen happen, dey wen run go tell everybody inside da town an all ova da place wat dey wen see. All da peopo wen come fo look. Wen dey come by Jesus, dey spock da guy, an he no mo da bad kine spirits now. He stay sitting by Jesus feet wit clotheses on, an he tink good stuff now. An all da peopo wen come real scared. Da guys dat wen see wat wen happen, dey tell da peopo bout da guy dat da bad kine spirits wen take ova, dat he stay good now. Den all da peopo from aroun Gerasa town aks Jesus fo go way from dem, cuz dey real, real scared. So he go inside da boat an go way. Da guy dat no mo bad kine spirits now, he wen beg Jesus if he can go wit him, but Jesus tell him, “No, brah. No can.” Jesus tell, 39 “Go home. Tell how God wen help you plenny.” So da guy go way an tell all ova da town how Jesus wen help him plenny. Wen Jesus come back, plenny peopo feel good inside fo see um, cuz dey stay waiting fo him. Had one leada guy from da Jewish church, name Jairus. Right den an dea he wen come an go down by Jesus feet. He beg Jesus fo go his house, 42 cuz his ony girl, bout twelve years old, litto mo mahke ova dea. Wen Jesus stay going, get plenny peopo stay jamming him. Had one wahine ova dea dat stay bleeding twelve years. She wen pay everyting she get to da doctas, but nobody can make her come good. She wen come behind Jesus, touch his clothe- ses. Right den an dea she wen pau bleed. Jesus say, “Who wen touch me?” Everybody tell him, “Not me!” Peter say, “Boss, get uku paila peopo aroun you, jamming agains you.” 46 But Jesus tell, “Somebody wen touch me. I know, cuz power wen go out from inside me.” 47 Den da wahine wen know dat dey goin find out, an she come an go down by Jesus feet, shaking real hard. In front all da peopo she wen tell how come she wen touch him, an how quick time she wen come good. Jesus tell her, “Sista, you trus me, dass why you come good awready. Go. Now yoa heart can stay rest inside.” 49 Wen Jesus still talking, one guy come from Jairus house, an say, “Yoa girl mahke awready. No need bodda da teacha no moa.” 50 Wen Jesus hear dat, he turn aroun an tell Jairus, “No scared, ony trus me, an she goin come good.” 51 Wen Jesus wen come Jairus house, he ony let Peter, John, an James, an da fadda an mudda go inside wit him, an no odda peopo. Same time all da peopo wen cry an moan fo her. Jesus tell, “Stop crying! She not mahke, she ony stay sleeping.” 53 An dey all wen laugh an make fun a him, cuz dey know she mahke. But Jesus take her hand an say, “Eh litto girl, get up!” 55 Right den an dea her life wen come back, an she wen get up. Den Jesus tell um, “Give her someting fo eat.” 56 An her fadda an mudda, wen blow dea minds. But Jesus tell One Mahke Girl an One Sick Wahine um, “Eh! No tell nobody wat wen happen, (Matthew 9:18-26; Mark 5:21-43) aah.” 9 Jesus Send His Twelve Guys All Ova (Matthew 10:5-15; Mark 6:7-13) 1 Jesus tell his twelve guys fo come togedda, an he give um da right an da power fo make all da bad kine spirits let go peopo, an make all kine sick peopo come good. Den he send um all ova fo tell everybody bout how dey can get God fo dea King, an fo make da sick peopo come good. He tell um, “No take notting fo da trip; no walking stick, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra clotheses. Wen you guys go somebodyʼs house, stay dea till you go way from dat town. If da peopo inside da town no like you guys come, an no like hear wat you guys teach, den wen you guys go outa da town, dust da dust from yoa feet, fo show da peopo dea dat God no like if dey no listen.” 6 So da guys wen go out an go from one small town to anodda, an dey teach da Good Stuff From God, an make da sick peopo all ova da place come good. King Herod Come All Mix Up (Matthew 14:1-12; Mark 6:14-29) 7 Dat time King Herod wen hear bout all dat wen happen. An he come all mix up, cuz some peopo wen say John Da Baptiza Guy, he wen come back alive. Odda peopo say dat Elijah wen show up. An oddas dat one guy dat wen talk fo God long time ago wen come back alive. Herod say, “I wen make my army guys cut off Johnʼs head. Den who dis guy?

Dey say, “Boss, even da bad kine spirits do wat we say, cuz we yoa guys, an we use yoa name.” 18 Jesus tell um, “I wen see da Devil, dat time God wen throw um down from da sky jalike da lightning. Listen! I wen give you guys da power so you can walk on top da snakes an da scorpions, an you guys get da power fo win ova da guy dat stay agains us, da Devil. You guys get plenny mo power den da Devil get. An notting goin hurt you guys. But no stay good inside jus cuz da bad spirits do wat you tell um. Stay good inside cuz God get you guys names inside his book inside da sky.” Jesus Stay Good Inside (Matthew 11:25-27; 13:16-17) 21 Dat time Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen make Jesus stay real good inside. An he say, “Fadda, you da Boss all ova da sky an da world. Mahalo plenny, cuz you wen hide all dis stuff from da smart guys an da guys dat know plenny stuff, an you wen show um to da small kids. Dass wat you like do.” 22 Jesus tell, “My Fadda give me every- ting, you know. Nobody know me like my Fadda know me. An nobody know my Fadda fo real kine, ony me, I know him, an da peopo I like show him, dey know him too.” 23 Den Jesus wen turn aroun to his guys an tell um (but he neva tell da odda peopo), “You guys stay good inside cuz you see da stuff you see! I telling you, Plenny kings an plenny guys dat wen talk fo God wen like see an hear da stuff you guys see an hear, but dey neva.” 25 One teacha dat teach Godʼs Rules wen stand up fo aks Jesus one question fo trick him. He say, “Teacha, wat I gotta do fo get da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva?” 26 Jesus say, “Tell me, wat Godʼs Rules say inside da Bible?” 27 He say, “Get love an aloha fo da Boss yoa God wit all yoa heart, an wit everyting inside you, an wit how you tink, an wit all yoa power. An get love an aloha fo everybody jalike you get love fo yoaself.” 28 Jesus say, “Dass right! Do dat an you goin live fo real kine.” 29 But da guy like make himself look good, so he aks, “Wat you mean, love an aloha fo everybody?” 30 Jesus say, “Had one guy. He wen go Jericho town from Jerusalem. Den had some guys dat wen jump him, rip him off, bus him up, an leave him dea fo mahke. Bumbye one Jewish priest guy come dat same road. He spock da guy, an go da odda side. Same ting, one guy from da Levi ohana dat help da prieses, he spock him, an go da odda side too. Den one guy from Samaria going dat road wen come wea da guy stay, spock him, an get pity fo him. He go by him, put olive oil an wine on top his cuts, an wrap um up. He put da guy on top his own donkey, an bring him by da hotel, an take care him. Da nex day he take out two silva coins an give um to da boss fo da hotel, an say, ‘Take care him, an wen I come back I give you wateva you wen pay.’ 36“Now, wat you tink? From da three guys dat wen pass, who wen get mo love an aloha fo da guy dose guys wen bus up?” 37 Da teacha guy say, “Da guy dat wen show pity fo him.” Jesus say, “Go, make lidat.” Jesus Go See Marta An Mary 38 Jesus an da guys he teach wen go down one road, an dey come to one small town. One wahine name Marta stay dea. She wen tell um fo come inside her house. She get one sista name Mary, an Mary wen sit down by Jesus feet an listen to wat he say. But wen bodda Marta cuz ony her was doing all da work, an she come an tell, Da Good Guy From Samaria “Boss, you no care dat my sista wen leave (Da Rules Second Time 6:5; Da Prieses 19:18) me all by myself fo do everyting? Tell her fo come help me!” 41 Da Boss wen tell Marta, “Marta! You bum out, an you worry bout plenny stuff, 42 but you ony need one ting. Mary wen pick da mo betta ting, an nobody can take dat away from her.” 11 Jesus Teach His Guys How Fo Pray (Matthew 6:9-15; 7:7-11) 1 One time Jesus stay pray in one place. Wen he pau pray, one guy he teaching tell um, “Boss, teach us guys fo pray, jalike John wen teach his guys.” 2 Jesus say, “Dis how you pray: ‘Fadda, We like all da peopo know fo shua how awesome you stay, An dat you stay good an spesho. We like you come King fo everybody now. Give us our food fo today an every day. Let us go, an hemo our shame Fo all da bad kine stuff we do to you, Jalike we let da odda guy go, An we no stay huhu at him Fo all da bad kine stuff he do to us. No let us get chance fo do bad kine stuff.’ ” 5 An he tell his guys, “Tink! If you go one friendʼs house at midnite an tell um, ‘My friend, lend me three loaf bread, 6 cuz my odda friend stay going on one trip, an he wen come my house, an I no mo notting fo give him fo eat.’ 7 Den if yoa friend inside his house tell you, ‘No bodda me! Da door stay lock awready, an me an my kids stay in bed. I no can get up fo give you anyting.’ 8 So, wat? I tell you, even if he yoa friend, he no goin get up an give you da bread. Still yet, cuz you no shame, an you stay aksing him, he goin get up an give you everyting you need. So I tell you: Aks, an you goin get. Look, you goin find. Knock, da door goin open fo you. All da peopo dat aks, goin get. Da guy dat look fo um, he goin find. An da guy dat knock da door, da door goin open fo him. If yoa boy aks you fo one fish, you give um one snake? Nah! If he aks you fo one egg, you give um one scorpion? Nah! Eh, you guys no good, but you know how fo give good kine stuff to yoa kids. Fo shua den, yoa Fadda inside da sky, he everytime good, an he goin give his Good an Spesho Spirit to you guys cuz you aks him fo um.” 14 Had one guy dat get one bad kine spirit, dat make da guy so he no can talk. Jesus wen make da bad spirit let go da guy. Wen da bad spirit let um go, da guy dat no can talk wen start fo talk. An all da peopo, wen blow dea minds. But some guys say, “Nah! Was Beelzebul, da Devil. He da main leada guy fo da bad kine spirits, you know. Beelzebul, he da one wen give Jesus da power fo make dat spirit let go da guy, az why!” 16 Odda guys wen try fo trick Jesus. Dey aks um fo show dem someting awesome from God in da sky fo make proof who him. But Jesus wen know wat dey tinking, an he tell um, “Da country dat go agains each odda, bus up itself. Da town o da ohana dat go agains each odda, no can stay strong. If da Devil make his own guys let go da peopo, den he going agains himself. How he goin stay one strong king? I saying dis cuz you guys wen say dat I make da bad kine spirits let go da peopo, cuz dea leada guy Beelzebul give me power fo do um. You guys say, dat da leada guy fo da bad kine spirits, he da one dat give me power fo make um let go da peopo. Kay den. Who give yoa guys da power fo make da bad kine spirits let go da peopo, aah? Da Devil give um da power, o wat? Not da Devil, dass fo shua. Yoa own guys goin show dat wat you say stay wrong. But if I make da bad kine spirits let go da peopo, cuz I get power from God, dat show dat God stay King, an he stay hea now by you guys, an you guys neva know. If one big moke get all his knifes an clubs fo guard his house, den his stuffs stay safe. But if one mo bigga moke come, an bus him up, he goin take away da knifes an clubs. Da first moke wen trus da knifes an clubs, but da mo bigga moke goin rip off all da stuffs, an split um up wit his own guys. If you no stay wit me, den you stay agains me. Da guy dat no work wit me, he ony work agains me.” Da Bad Spirit Come Back (Matthew 12:43-45) 24 “Wen one bad kine spirit let go one guy, dat spirit go all ova da boonies fo find Jesus An Beelzebul one place fo rest, but no can find notting. (Matthew 12:22-30; Mark 3:20-27) Den he say, ‘Eh, mo betta I go back to da guy I wen take ova befo.’ 25 Wen he go dea, da guy stay clean inside, jalike wen you sweep one house an fix um up. Den da spirit go get seven odda spirits mo worse den him, an dey all go take ova da guy, an stay dea. So in da end, da guy dat had da bad kine spirit come mo worse den befo.” Stay Good Inside Fo Real Kine 27 Wen Jesus say dat, one wahine from da peopo wen say, “Da wahine dat wen born you an nurse you, she da one dat stay good inside!” 28 But Jesus tell, “Da peopo dat hear wat God say, an do um, dey da ones dat stay real good inside!” Show Us Proof! (Matthew 12:38-42; Mark 8:12) 29 All da peopo wen stay jamming aroun Jesus, an he say, “Da peopo nowdays, dey do bad kine stuff. Dey everytime like see proof dat I fo real. An dey no goin see um. Dey ony goin see one proof jalike da guy Jonah wen make befo time. Jonah, he talk fo God long time ago. He wen make proof fo da peopo inside Nineveh town dat he come from God. O same jalike me, da Guy Dass Fo Real, I goin make proof fo da peopo nowdays, dat I come from God. Wen da peopo dat stay hea nowdays goin stand in front God da Judge, da Queen from Sheba far away da sout side goin stand up too, an make proof dat da peopo dat stay hea nowdays, dey not so smart. Cuz befo time she wen come from far away fo hear wat da akamai guy, King Solomon, wen say. An look! Get one guy mo importan den Solomon stay hea now. Dass me! Wen da peopo dat stay hea nowdays goin stand in front God da Judge, da peopo inside Nineveh town goin stand up too, an make proof dat da peopo dat stay hea nowdays, dey stay doing bad kine stuff. Cuz wen Jonah wen teach da Nineveh peopo, dey wen come sorry fo all da bad kine stuff dey wen do, an pau do um. An now get one guy mo importan den Jonah stay hea now. Dass me!” 33 “You no light one candle an den cover um up. You put um up on top one high place, yeah? Den everybody dat come inside da house can see da light. Da eye jalike one lamp fo inside yoa body. So if you get good heart fo help peopo, dass jalike yoa eye okay an you stay all light inside. But if you one greedy bugga, dass jalike yoa eye stay no good an you stay all dark inside! Make shua you get da light inside you, an you no stay dark inside. So, if you get good heart inside you, an you not greedy, dass jalike you get light inside you fo shua!” wen do. Dey wen kill da guys dat wen Dat Teach Godʼs Rules 20:45-47) 37 Wen Jesus pau talk, one Pharisee guy wen aks him fo come inside his house fo eat. So he go inside, an sit down fo eat. But da Pharisee guy see dat Jesus no wash first befo he eat jalike dem, an he tink plenny bout dat. So da Boss Jesus tell him, “You know, you Pharisee guys, jalike you, you guys clean ony da outside a da cup an da plate. But inside yoa heart, you guys stay full a bad kine stuff, an you like stash everyting fo yoaself. You guys no tink! Da One dat wen make da outside, make da inside too! Give to da peopo dat no mo notting from da stuffs you get, an you know wat? Everyting goin come okay fo you guys, da way God see you. “Auwe you Pharisee guys! You goin get it! You guys give God ten percent a everyting, even da mint, an da rue spice, an all da odda kine herbs. But same time, no bodda you guys if you no do da right tings, an you guys no mo love an aloha fo God. Mo betta, make shua you do da right tings, an get love an aloha fo God, an no foget da ten percent too. “Auwe you Pharisee guys! You guys goin get it! You guys everytime like fo sit down in da spesho chairs inside da Jewish churches, an like all da peopo talk nice to you in da open market. Auwe! Cuz you guys mahke inside, jalike da graves dat da peopo no can see, an dey walk on top um cuz dey donno get one grave dea.” Da Light Fo Da Body 45 One teacha dat teach Godʼs Rules wen (Matthew 5:15; 6:22-23) tell um, “Teacha, wen you say dat, you talk bad to us too.” 46 Jesus say, “Auwe you teacha guys dat teach Godʼs Rules! You guys goin get it! Cuz you like make all kine rules! Jalike you stack up big heavy kine stuffs on top da peopoʼs shouldas, dat real hard fo carry. But you guys no like help da peopo fo do wat yoa rules say, even litto bit. Auwe you guys! Cuz you make nice tombs fo da guys dat wen talk fo God, but was yoa ancesta guys wen kill um. So you show you tink dass good, wat yoa ancesta guys talk fo God, an you guys make dea tombs! Dass why God wen know wat he talking Jesus Scold Da Pharisee Guys An Da Teachas bout wen he say, ‘I goin send um guys (Matthew 23:1-36; Mark 12:38-40; Luke dat talk fo me, an guys I send all ova fo tell da Good Stuff, an dey goin kill some, an make oddas suffa.’ 50 So da peopo dat stay hea nowdays, dey goin get da blame fo all da guys dat peopo eva wen kill cuz dey talk fo God, 51 from da first one Abel to Zekariah. Dey wen kill Zekariah right inside da temple yard, wit Godʼs spesho place one side, an da altar da odda side. Dass right! An I like tell you guys dis: Da guys dat stay hea nowdays, dey goin get all da blame. “Auwe, you teachas dat teach Godʼs Rules! You guys goin get it! You guys donno wat God say, an you no let da peopo dat like know wat he say find out. Jalike you guys wen take away da key fo open da door so peopo can know wat God stay say.” 53 Wen Jesus go way from dat place, da teachas dat teach Godʼs Rules an da Pharisee guys wen start fo gang up on him, an try fo make him tell dem all kine stuff. Dey like trick him wit wat he tell dem so Jewish church peopo, o in front da leada dey can bus him. Bumbye uku plenny peopo wen come togedda, dat dey even step on top each odda.

Today God take him outa all da bad kine stuff he doing. Cuz me, da Guy Dass Fo Real, I wen come hea fo look fo da guys dat stay cut off from God, fo take um outa da bad kine stuff dey doing.” 11 Da peopo hear wat Jesus wen say. Den Jesus tell um anodda story, cuz he stay near Jerusalem, an da peopo tink dat God goin come King right away ova dea. Jesus tell, “Had one ali‛i dat wen go one far place fo come king an den come back. Befo he go, he tell ten worka guys fo come. He give every guy one gold coin.

How come you neva put my money inside da bank, so dat wen I come back I can get my money an mo too?’ 24 Den he tell da guys dat standing dea, ‘Eh, take away dis guyʼs gold coin from um, an give um to da guy dat get ten coins.’ 25 Dey say, ‘Az not fair, Boss!

Dey say, “God goin do plenny good kine stuff fo dis guy! Everyting stay good wit God an da peopo. Den some Pharisee guys from da peopo tell Jesus, “Teacha, scold yoa guys! Not good, wat dey saying!” 40 Jesus say, “I telling you, if dey shut up, God in da sky wen give John da right,’ den even da stones goin yell same ting.” 41 Jesus come near Jerusalem an look da town, an he cry.

Den he go way long time. Wen da time come fo cut da Jesus Go Inside Da Temple grapes, he send one worka guy by da guys (Matthew 21:12-17; Mark 11:15-19; John dat rent his farm, so dey can give him some grapes.

Dey send some guys fo watch him. Dem guys wen ack like dey good guys. Dey like trick Jesus wit wat he say, so dey can turn him ova to da leada guys an to da governa who get power. So da guys dat stay watching him tell him, “Eh, Teacha, we know dat you talk strait an wat you say an teach stay true. You do da same to everybody, an you teach Godʼs way fo real kine. So, wat?

Dat time dem guys no goin marry no can mahke, but dey goin stay jalike da angel guys. Cuz dey Godʼs kids, an dey goin come back alive. Now, long time ago, wen Moses wen spock one bush dat stay burning, he wen talk to God ova dea.

An everyting dey wen write, goin happen!” 45 Den he wen help dem undastan da Bible. He tell um, “Dis wat dey wen write, ‘Da Christ guy, da Spesho Guy God Goin Send, he goin suffa an mahke, an den come back alive on day numba three afta he mahke. Afta dat, his guys goin teach all da diffren peopos inside da whole world bout Christ guy, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send.

I goin send you guys wat my Fadda wen promise you. So stay hea inside Jerusalem till you guys get da power dat come from God in da sky.” 50 Den Jesus take his guys outside Jerusalem, Betany side. He hold up his hands an aks God fo do good tings fo dem. Same time wen Jesus stay aksing God fo do good tings fo dem, he start fo go up inside da sky. Den dey all go down on dea knees fo show Jesus love an respeck. Den dey go back to Jerusalem. An dey stay real good inside. Dey stay inside da temple yard, praying an telling God how good he stay. Jesus Go Up Inside Da Sky (Mark 16:19-20; Acts 1:9-11) 46; 17:5; Songs fo God 33:6) 1 Da time everyting had start, had one Guy. “Godʼs Talk,” dass who him.

But everybody dat take him in an trus him, God give dem da right fo come his kids, cuz dey know who him. Da way dey born, not da regula way, wit one guy fo dea fadda dat like get kids.

Den plenny odda peopo wen trus him, cuz dey wen hear wat he say. Den dey tell da wahine, “Befo, we ony hear wat you wen tell us. But now we trus him cuz we hear him ourself, an we know fo shua dat dis da Guy who can take all us guys in da whole world outa da bad kine stuff we stay in.” Jesus Make One Leada Guyʼs Boy Come Good 43 Afta Jesus wen stay dea two days, he wen go Galilee side. You know, Jesus wen tell befo, “One talka fo God no mo respeck inside his own town.” 45 But befo, Passova time, da peopo from Galilee wen go Jerusalem fo da spesho religious time.

Jesus Make One Guy Come Good By One Water Place 1 Latas Jesus wen go Jerusalem, cuz da Jewish peopo get one spesho religious time. Inside Jerusalem get one big water place near da Gate fo da Sheeps. Get five lanai dea. Da peopo call um “Betzata” in da local language. Inside da lanai plenny sick peopo was lying down: blind peopo, peopo dat no can walk, an peopo dat no can move. [Dey stay waiting fo weneva da water move. Cuz you know, sometimes one angel guy from da Boss go down inside da water an make um move. Afta dat, da first guy dat go inside da water, he come good from wateva kine sick he get.] 5 Had one guy dea dat was sick thirty- eight years. Jesus see him lying dea. He know dat da guy stay sick long time awready. So he aks him, “You like come good?” 7 Da sick guy tell him, “Mista, I no mo nobody fo put me inside wen da water start fo move. Cuz wen I trying fo go inside, anodda guy go inside first.” 8 Jesus tell him, “Get up! Take yoa mat an respeck fo him. Whoeva no mo respeck fo walk!” 9 Right den an dea da guy wen come good. He take his mat an wen walk. Was da Rest Day wen dat wen happen. So da Jewish leada guys tell da guy dat wen come good, “Eh, dis da Rest Day!

Bumbye Jesus wen find da guy inside da temple yard. He say, “Eh, you stay good now. No go do da bad kine stuff no moa, o mo worse ting goin happen to you.” 15 Den da guy go way an tell da Jewish leada guys dat was Jesus wen make him come good. Dass why dem guys wen start fo make Jesus suffa, cuz he wen make da guy come good on da Rest Day. So Jesus tell dem, “My Fadda still yet stay doing da kine good tings, an I do da same ting too.” 18 Dass why da Jewish leada guys wen try mo hard fo kill him, cuz he wen broke da Rules bout da Rest Day. An even mo worse, he wen say dat God his own Fadda. Dat mean he wen make himself jalike God. So Jesus tell dem, “You guys get um fo shua! An I tell you guys dis: I no can do notting by myself. I Godʼs Boy, an I ony do da stuff I see my Fadda doing. Wateva my Fadda do, dass wat I do. Same ting. My Fadda get love an aloha fo me, his Boy. An he show me everyting dat he stay doing.

An da peopo who hear me, an listen to wat I say, dey goin live fo real kine. Jalike my Fadda, he can make da peopo come alive fo real kine, same ting, cuz I his Boy he give me da power fo make um come alive too. My Fadda wen give me da right fo be da judge fo everybody, cuz I his Boy, da Guy Dass Fo Real. No let dis blow yoa minds, cuz da time goin come wen all da mahke guys goin hear my voice. An dey goin come outa dea graves. Da peopo dat wen do da good kine stuff goin come back fo live again, an da peopo dat wen do da bad kine stuff goin come back fo get punish. Godʼs Boy Get Da Right Fo Make Like God Da One Dat Tell Bout Jesus (Daniel 7:13) 30 “I no can do notting by myself. I da judge, but wen I say dey wen do good o bad, dat come from wat my Fadda tell me. Dass how come I can judge um right, cuz I not trying fo do wat I like, but ony wat my Fadda like.

But you guys neva hear him o see him. You guys no mo wat God say inside you guys, cuz you guys no trus me, an I da guy he wen send. You guys go check out da Bible everytime, cuz you guys tink you goin find da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva, inside da Bible from befo time. But wen da Bible talk bout how fo get da real kine life, dass me he talking bout. An you guys, you no like come by me an be my guys so dat you guys can get da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. “I no need peopo fo tell me I awesome. But I know you guys. I know dat you guys no mo love an aloha fo God inside you. I wen come to dis world cuz my Fadda wen give me da right fo come fo him. But you guys neva like trus me o listen to me. If anodda guy come by himself, jus cuz he like, you guys goin trus da guy. You guys like talk good bout each odda, but you guys no do notting fo make God talk good bout you guys. He da ony God. Den how you guys goin trus him? No tink I goin poin finga at you guys to da Fadda. But get one guy dat stay poining finga at you guys.

Anybody take dis bread, dey goin live to da max foeva. Dis da bread I goin give wen I mahke, my body. An dis goin make you live to da max foeva.” 52 Den da Jewish guys wen start fo argue mo hard wit each odda. Dey say, “Eh, wat dis guy talking bout? How he can give us his body fo eat?” 53 Jesus tell dem, “Eh, you guys get um! An I like tell you guys dis too: I da Guy Dass Fo Real. If you guys no take wat I telling you guys bout why I goin mahke, no way you guys goin come alive fo real kine. If you guys take um, dass jalike you guys eat my body an drink my blood. Jalike I wen say: Whoeva eat my body an drink my blood, dey goin live to da max foeva, an I goin bring um back alive wen da world goin pau. Cuz my body, dass food fo real kine.

Whoeva eat dis kine bread goin live fo real kine.” 59 Jesus say all dat wen he stay teaching inside da Jewish church, Capernaum side. Come Alive Foeva 60 Den plenny guys dat go wit Jesus, wen dey wen hear all dat stuff, dey say, “Wow! Dis stuff too hard fo believe!” 61 But Jesus wen know dat his guys stay squawking lidat. So he aks um, “Wat! Dis bodda you guys? Eh, wat if bumbye you guys see me, da Guy Dass Fo Real, going back up dea, to da place wea I wen stay befo? Den wat? “Godʼs Spirit, dass who make da peopo live fo real kine. Da body no can. Wat I stay telling you guys, dass from Godʼs Spirit, an dass wat make peopo live fo real kine. But get some a you guys dat no trus me.” Jesus wen say dat cuz he wen know from da start who no trus him, an who goin set up him. An he say, “Dass why I wen tell you guys, no mo nobody can come by me an be my guy. Ony if da Fadda like help um, den dey can come.” 66 From dat time had plenny guys dat he wen teach befo, but some a dem wen go back, an neva like go wit him no moa. So Jesus aks his twelve guys, “Eh, you guys goin go way too, o wat?” 68 Den Simon Peter tell him, “Boss, wea we goin go? No mo nobody can tell us how fo live to da max foeva. You da ony one. An us guys trus you, cuz we know dat you da Good An Spesho One from God.” 70 Jesus tell um, “I wen pick all twelve a you guys, yeah? But still yet, one a you guys, he jalike one devil!” 71 He mean Judas, Simon Iscariotʼs boy. He one a da twelve guys, but latas Judas goin set up Jesus. Jesus an His Bruddas 1 Afta dat, Jesus go aroun inside Galilee. He neva like go aroun inside Judea, cuz da spesho religious time, wen da Jewish peopo rememba da time dea ancesta guys wen walk all ova da boonies, an stay inside shacks, long time befo. Den Jesus bruddas tell him, “Go way from hea, an go Judea side, so da peopo you wen teach can see da kine stuff you stay doing. If one guy like everybody know bout him, he no goin do stuff wea nobody can see him, yeah? Da Good Kine Stuff from God Make Peopo You stay doing all dis kine stuff, so, let everybody all ova da place see you doing um!” 5 You know, even Jesus bruddas neva trus him. Jesus tell dem, “Az not time fo me fo go yet. You guys can go any time. Da peopo inside da world, dey no goin hate you guys. But dey hate me, cuz I tell um dat da kine stuff dey stay doing, dass bad kine stuff. You guys go Jerusalem fo da spesho religious time. I no going yet, cuz not time fo me fo go.” 9 Afta he wen say dat, den he wen stay Galilee side. But afta Jesus bruddas wen go da spesho religious time, den he wen go too. But nobody know he wen come. Den da Jewish leada guys, dey stay looking fo him at da spesho religious time. Dey wen aks da peopo, “Wea dat bugga stay?” 12 All da peopo stay talking bout him to each odda. Some peopo say, “He one good guy, you know.” Odda peopo say, “Nah! He bulai da peopo.” 13 But nobody talk loud bout him, cuz dey scared da Jewish leada guys. In da middle a da spesho religious time awready Jesus go inside da temple yard an start fo teach. Da Jewish leada guys, wen blow dea minds. Dey say, “How come dis bugga know all dis stuff? He neva study wit da odda teachas, you know.” 16 Jesus tell dem, “Da stuff I teach, no come from me. Come from da One who wen send me. If anybody like do wat God like um fo do, dey goin know if da stuff I teaching come from God, o if ony come from my own head. Da guy dat tell stuff dat come from his own head, he ony like make peopo tink he awesome. But if one guy like peopo fo tink dat da one who wen send him stay awesome, dat guy stay telling da trut. He no notting wrong. Moses wen give you guys Godʼs Rules, but no mo nobody from you guys do wat Godʼs Rules say. So, how come you guys trying fo kill me?” 20 All da peopo say, “Wassa matta you? You get one bad kine spirit in charge a you, o wat? Wat you mean, somebody trying fo kill you?” 21 Jesus tell dem, “I wen do one awesome ting, an dat wen blow all you guys minds. Moses wen give you guys da Rule fo cut skin on day numba eight afta one baby boy wen born, an you guys do um fo one baby boy, no matta da Rest Day. (You know, our ancesta guys wen do dat long time befo Moses. No was Moses dat wen give um da Rule first time.) 23 Now, if you guys can cut skin on one guy on da Rest Day fo no broke Moses Rules, how come you guys come huhu wit me cuz I wen make one sick guy come good on da Rest Day? No ack like one judge wen you guys can see ony da outside stuff. If you guys goin ack like one Jesus Go Da Spesho Religious Time judge, gotta figga um da right way.” Dis Godʼs Spesho Guy? Den some peopo from Jerusalem wen say, “Eh! Dis da guy dey stay looking fo, cuz dey like kill him, yeah? But, wow! He stay talking hea in front everybody, an nobody tell him fo shut his mout. Wat you guys tink? You tink da leada guys wen figga dat dis guy, he da Spesho Guy God Goin Send, fo real kine, o wat? But us guys, we know wea dis guy wen come from. Wen God send his Spesho Guy Christ, nobody goin know wea he wen come from.” 28 Jesus stay teaching inside da temple yard. Wen he hear dem guys say dat, he talk real strong an say, “You guys tink you know me, an wea I wen come from? I neva come hea by myself, fo do wat I like. Da One who wen send me, he fo real. But you guys donno him. But I know him, cuz I wen come from him, an he wen send me hea.” 30 Den dey wen try fo take him, but nobody wen grab him, cuz not time yet. But plenny peopo dat stay dea wen trus him. Dey say, “Wen Christ, Godʼs Spesho Guy come, you tink he goin do mo awesome stuff fo show who him den dis guy? Nah!” Dey Send Da Police Fo Bus Jesus 32 Da Pharisee guys wen hear all da peopo saying dat stuff bout Jesus. So dem guys an da main priest guys wen send da police guys from da temple fo bus him. Den Jesus say, “I ony goin stay wit you guys litto bit mo time, an den I goin go back to da One who wen send me hea. You guys goin look fo me, but you no goin find me, cuz wea I going, you guys no can go ova dea.” 35 Den da Jewish leada guys tell each odda, “Wea dis bugga going, an we no can find him? You tink he going by da Jewish peopo inside da Greek towns far away, fo teach da peopo dat talk da Greek language, o wat? Wat he mean wen he say, ‘You guys goin look fo me, but you no goin find me,’ an ‘Da place I goin stay, you guys no can go dea’?” 37 On da last day a da spesho religious time, dass da main day, Jesus wen stand up, an talk real loud. He say, “Whoeva stay thirsty, let um come by me fo drink. Jalike da Bible say, ‘Whoeva trus me, dey come alive inside dem. An dey goin help he go inside da Temple yard early. Every- make da odda peopo come alive too, jalike body come wea he stay. Den he sit down one river dat get plenny water inside um dea fo teach dem. Da guys dat teach Godʼs give da kine water fo help da peopo live.’ Rules an da Pharisee guys wen find one ” 39 Jesus say dat bout Godʼs Spirit, cuz wahine fooling aroun wit one guy dat not bumbye da peopo who trus Jesus goin get her husban. So dey bring her in front Jesus Godʼs Spirit. Dat time Jesus wen say dat, an all da peopo. Dey tell him, “Teacha, dey neva get da Spirit yet, cuz God neva we wen find dis wahine fooling aroun wit make Jesus come awesome yet. Plenny peopo wen hear him say dat. An dey say, “Fo shua, dis da Spesho Guy dat goin come fo talk fo God!” 41 Da odda guys say, “Dis da Christ guy, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send!” But da odda guys say, “You tink Godʼs Spesho Guy goin come from Galilee? Nah! Da Bible say dat da Christ guy goin come from King David ancesta guys, an goin come from Betlehem, wea King David wen live, yeah?” 43 So da peopo wen split in half cuz a Jesus. Some guys wen like grab him an bus him, but nobody wen touch him. Da police guys wen go back by da main priest guys an da Pharisee guys. An da priest guys wen aks da police guys, “Eh! How come you guys neva bring him hea?” 46 Dey say, “Wow! Nobody eva talk like dat guy Jesus!” 47 Da Pharisee guys say, “Wat! He wen bulai you guys too? You know, no mo leada guys o Pharisee guys dat trus him. But dis peopo, dey donno Godʼs Rules, an God goin punish dem!” 50 Nicodemus, he one a da Pharisee guys. He da guy wen come fo talk to Jesus one nite befo time. He say, 51 “Our Rules say, we gotta listen to da guy first, an find out wat he wen do. Den we can figga if he wen do good o bad.” 52 Dey tell him, “Wot! You no come from Galilee jalike him! Go check out da Bible. Da Water Dat Make da Peopo Live You goin find out dat nobody dat eva talk fo God come from Galilee!” (Nehemiah 9:15,19-20; Ezekiel 47:1-12) 53 [Den everybody wen go home dea own place. Da Wahine Dat Wen Fool Aroun 1 But Jesus wen go Olive Ridge. Nex day anodda guy dat not her husban! Now, Da Peopo Split in Half Moses wen tell us in da Rules, ‘Whoeva fool (Da Rules Second Time 18:18-19) aroun behind da oddaʼs back, gotta throw big kine stones at um fo kill um.’ But you, wat you say?” 6 Dey say dat fo see wat he goin say, cuz dey like catch him fo bus him. But Jesus wen bend ova an write somet- ing wit his finga on top da dirt. So wen dey stay aks him ova an ova, he stand up strait an tell um, “If get one a you guys dat neva do bad kine stuff, he can throw da first stone at her.” 8 Den he bend ova one mo time, an write some mo on top da dirt. Wen dey hear dat, dey wen come shame cuz dey know dey do bad kine stuff too. So dey all go way, one afta da odda, da older guys first, an den da younga guys. Den Da Jewish Leada Guys No Trus Jesus get ony Jesus an da wahine standing dea. Jesus stand up again an say, “Sista, wea everybody stay? No mo nobody hea fo say you gotta mahke?” 11 She say, “No mo, Mista.” Jesus say, “You can go now, cuz I no say you gotta mahke. But no go do da bad kine stuff no moa.”] Jesus Jalike da Light fo da Peopo All Ova da World 12 Jesus wen talk to dem one mo time. He say, “I jalike da light fo da peopo inside da world. Whoeva come by me an be my guy, dey no goin go aroun inside da dark. Dey goin get da light dat make dem live fo real kine.” 13 Da Pharisee guys tell him, “Eh! You saying dis fo yoaself. No mo odda guy say um fo you. So dat not nuff fo make proof dat wat you say stay true.” 14 Jesus tell dem, “No matta I talk fo myself, wat I say stay true. I know wea I wen come from, an wea I going. But you guys, you donno wea I wen come from, o wea I going. You guys figga how one guy stay from looking at him on da outside. I no tink lidat. No matta if I say one guy good o bad, I wen tell da trut, cuz I no do um by myself. I get my Fadda fo help me, cuz he da One wen send me hea. Yoa own Rules say dat wen two peopo tell da same ting, den wat dey say stay true. Kay den. I tell bout myself, an my Fadda who wen send me hea, he tell da same ting bout me.” 19 Dey tell, “Yeah? Yoa fadda, wea he stay?” Jesus say, “You guys donno me o my Fadda. If you guys wen know me, den you guys wen know my Fadda too.” 20 Jesus wen say all dat wen he wen teach inside da Temple, near da place wea dey bring da money. An nobody bus him, cuz not time yet fo dat. “Da Place I Going, You Guys No Can Go Dea” 21 Jesus tell dem again, “I going away, an you guys goin look fo me. Da place I going, you guys no can go dea. But you guys goin mahke wit all da bad kine stuff you guys stay doing.” 22 So da Jewish leada guys say, “Wat he talking bout? He goin kill himself, o wat? Cuz he say, ‘Da place I going, you guys no can go dea.’ ” 23 Jesus tell dem, “You guys come from down hea, I come from up dea. You guys come from dis world, I no come from dis world. Dass why I wen say dat you guys goin mahke wit all da bad kine stuff you guys stay doing. Cuz if you guys no believe dat I da Spesho Guy, den you guys goin mahke wit all yoa bad kine stuff.” 25 So dey aks him, “Eh, who you?” Jesus say, “I da same guy, jalike I wen tell you guys from da start. Get plenny bad kine stuff I can tell bout you guys, but I kine stuff Abraham wen do. But now no goin tell um. Da One who wen send me hea, he everytime tell da trut. I ony tell da peopo inside da world da stuff I wen hear from him.” 27 (He mean his Fadda. But dem guys, dey no undastan.) 28 Jesus tell dem, “Bumbye you guys goin put me, da Guy Dass Fo Real, up high. Den you guys goin know dat I da Spesho Guy, an dat I no do notting by myself. I ony teach da stuff my Fadda wen teach me. Da One who wen send me hea, he stay wit me. He no leave me by myself. I everytime do da kine stuff dat he like.” 30 Wen he wen say all dat, plenny peopo wen trus him. “You Guys Goin Know Wat Stay True” 31 Den Jesus tell da Jewish peopo dat wen trus him, “If you guys stick wit me an da stuff I teaching you, den you goin be my guys fo real kine, an you guys goin learn mo plenny stuff from me. You guys goin know da true stuff, an den you guys no need be slave guys no moa.” 33 Dey tell him, “Ho! Us guys come from Abraham! We neva was slave guys eva! Wat you mean, ‘No need be slave guys no moa’?” 34 Jesus tell dem, “Dass right, wat I wen tell you! An I tell you guys dis too: Whoeva stay do da bad kine stuff, dey jalike one slave, cuz dey gotta do da bad kine stuff. You know, one slave guy no stay wit da boss foeva. Ony da bossʼs boy, he stay wit him foeva. So, I Godʼs Boy, an if I hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff you guys wen do, an let you guys go, den you guys no need be slave guys foeva. Fo shua you guys no need do da bad kine stuff! “I know dat you guys come from Abra- ham. But still yet, you guys trying fo kill me, cuz you guys no like take da stuff I stay teaching. I tell bout da stuff I wen see, dat my Fadda wen show me, an you guys do da stuff you wen hear bout from you guys fadda.” Da Devil, He You Guys Fadda 39 Dey tell him, “Us guys, eh, Abraham our fadda!” Jesus tell dem, “If you guys was Abra- hamʼs kids, den you guys suppose to do da you guys stay trying fo kill me, no matta I everytime tell you guys da trut, jalike I wen hear um from my Fadda. Abraham, he neva make like you guys! You guys do da kine stuff dat come from yoa fadda.” Dey tell him, “Eh, us guys ony get one fadda, an he God! No mo odda guy our fadda!” 42 Jesus tell dem, “If God was you guys fadda, den you guys wen get love an aloha fo me, cuz I wen come from God, an now I stay hea. I neva come by myself, but God wen send me hea. How come you guys no can undastan da stuff I telling you? Cuz you guys no like listen, dass why! “You guys come from yoa fadda, da Devil! You guys like do da kine stuff he like do. From da start, he wen like kill da peopo. He no like da trut, cuz no mo notting true inside him. He everytime bulai, cuz dass wat he like do. He da first guy eva wen bulai, cuz dass how he stay. I stay telling throw at Jesus. But he wen hide an wen go you guys da trut, but you guys no trus me. You guys no can show proof dat I wen do da bad kine stuff, yeah? So, if I stay telling da trut, how come you guys no trus me? “Whoeva come from God, dey listen to wat God say. Dass why you guys no like listen to me, cuz you guys no come from God.” 48 Da Jewish leada guys tell him, “Az right wat we saying! You one Samaria guy, not one real Jew, an you get one bad kine spirit in charge a you!” 49 Jesus tell dem, “I no mo bad kine spirit can see da awesome stuff God goin do fo da in charge a me. I show respeck fo my Fadda. But you guys no mo respeck fo me. I no try fo make peopo tink I awesome. Get anodda One dat show peopo how awesome I stay, an he da judge. “If you guys undastan dat, den I like tell you guys dis too: Whoeva listen to wat I say, dat guy no goin mahke, eva!” 52 Den da Jewish leada guys tell him, “Ho! Now we stay shua dat you get one bad kine spirit in charge a you. Abraham wen mahke, an da guys dat wen talk fo God long time ago, dey wen mahke too. But you still say, ‘Whoeva listen to wat I say, dey no goin mahke, eva.’ 53 You tink you mo importan den our fadda Abraham? He wen mahke awready. An da guys dat wen talk fo God, dey wen mahke too. Who you tink you, hah?” 54 Jesus say, “If I try make da peopo tink I awesome, dat no good. My Fadda, he da One dat show dem how awesome I stay. An you guys say dat he yoa God. But you guys neva know him. I know him. If I wen say dat I donno him, den I bulai, jalike you guys. But I know him, an I do wat he say. Abraham, dass you guys fadda. He wen stay real good inside wen he tink dat I goin come hea. He wen see dat, an he feel good inside.” 57 Da Jewish leada guys tell him, “Eh! you no make fifty years yet! Wat you mean, you wen see Abraham?” 58 Jesus tell dem, “Dass right! An I tell you guys dis too: Befo Abraham wen born, I wen stay awready.” 59 Den dem guys wen go get rocks fo outside from da temple yard. Jesus Make One Guy See Dat Wen Born Blind 1 Afta dat Jesus was walking, an he spock one guy dat wen born blind. Da guys Jesus stay teaching wen aks him, “Eh, Teacha! Who wen do bad kine stuff, dis guy o his “Befo Abraham Stay, I Stay Awready” mudda an fadda? Az why he wen born lidat, yeah?” 3 Jesus tell dem, “Not even him o his fadda o mudda. Az not why he wen born blind. He wen born lidat so dat everybody guy. God wen send me hea. We gotta do da kine stuff he tell us fo do now wen still get light. Bumbye nite time come, an den nobody can work. I stay inside da world now, an I jalike da light fo da peopo all ova da world.” 6 Afta Jesus say dat, he wen spit on top da dirt, an make some mud. Den he take some a dat an put um on top da guyʼs eyes. Den Jesus tell him, “Go, wash yoa face inside da Siloam water place.” Now, Siloam mean, “Dey Send Water Dea.” So da guy go ova dea an wash his face, an wen he go home, he can see! So da peopo dat stay live near da guy, an da oddas dat wen see him beg befo, dey say, “Eh, dis da guy dat wen sit an beg befo, yeah?” 9 Some peopo say, “Yeah, he da guy!” Odda peopo say, “Nah! He ony look like him.” But da guy say, “Yeah! I da guy!” 10So dey aks him, “How come you can see now?” 11 He tell dem, “Da guy Jesus wen make mud, an put um on top my eyes, an tell me, ‘Go da Siloam water place an wash.’ So I wen go an wash, an den I can see!” 12 Dey aks him, “Wea he stay?” He say, “I donno.” Was Blind 13 Den dey take da guy dat was blind to da Pharisee guys. Now, dat was da Rest Day wen Jesus wen make da mud an make da guy see. So da Pharisee guys wen aks him, “Eh, how come you can see?” Da guy tell dem, “He wen put mud on top my eyes, an I wen wash, an den I can see!” 16 Den some a da Pharisee guys say, “Dis guy no can come from God, cuz he do stuff he not suppose to do on da Rest Day.” But odda Pharisee guys say, “Nah! How can one bad kine guy do da kine awesome stuff dat show who him?” An dey wen argue wit each odda. So dey aks da guy dat was blind one mo time, “Eh, wat you say bout da guy dat wen make you see?” Da guy say, “He one talka fo God.” 18 Da Jewish leada guys neva believe dat da guy wen stay blind befo he wen see. So dey wen send guys fo bring his mudda an fadda. Dey aks da mudda an fadda, “Dis yoa boy? You say he wen born blind? How come he can see now?” 20 Da mudda an fadda say, “Yeah, dis our boy. An he wen born blind. But we donno how come he can see now, o who da guy wen make him see. Go aks him. He old nuff. He can talk fo himself.” 22 His mudda an fadda guys wen talk lidat, cuz dey scared da Jewish leada guys. Cuz dem guys wen awready talk togedda, an say, “If anybody say dat Jesus da Christ, da Spesho Guy from God, we goin throw him outa da Jewish church.” 23 Dass why his mudda an fadda guys wen say, “He old nuff. Go aks him.” 24 So dey tell da guy dat was blind fo come back one mo time. Dey say, “Eh! Tell da trut in front God! Us guys know fo shua dat dis bugga Jesus, he one bad guy.” 25 Da guy tell dem, “I donno if he one bad guy o wat. But I know one ting: befo I no can see -- now I can see!” 26 Dey aks him, “Wat he wen do to you? How he wen open yoa eyes?” 27 He tell dem, “I wen tell you guys awready, but you guys neva listen. How come you guys like hear um again? You guys like come his guys so he can teach you Da Pharisee Guys Check Out Da Guy Dat guys too?” 28 Den dey talk bad to him, an say, “You his guy, an you listen to him. Us guys, we Moses guys, an we ony listen to Moses. We know dat God wen talk to Moses. But dis bugga, we donno wea he come from.” 30 Da guy tell dem, “Wat! Dis blow my mind! You guys donno wea he wen come from, but still yet he wen make me see.” 31 An da guy say, “Now, we know dat God no listen to da bad kine guys. But he listen to da guys dat get respeck fo him an do wat he like.” 32 An da guy say, “Listen! From da time wen God wen make da world till now, nobody eva wen hear dat somebody wen make one guy see dat wen born blind.” 33 An da guy say, “If dis guy neva come from God, den he no can do notting.” 34 Dey tell him, “Eh, you ony do da bad kine stuff from da time you wen born! How come you tink you can teach us guys someting?” Den dey wen throw him outa da Jewish church. Blind Inside 35 Jesus wen hear dat dey wen throw da guy outa da Jewish church, so he go find da guy, an tell him, “You trus da Guy Dass Fo Real?” 36 Da guy say, “Who him, Mista? Tell me, so I can trus him.” 37 Jesus tell him, “You wen see him awready. Dass me, da guy talking to you.” 38 Da guy say, “Boss, I trus you!” An he go down on his knees in front Jesus. Jesus tell him, “I wen come inside dis world fo show who do da bad kine stuff. Bumbye da guys dat no can see, goin see, an da guys dat can see goin come blind.” 40 Had some Pharisee guys dea dat wen hear dat. Dey aks Jesus, “Eh!

He get bandage fo mahke guys aroun his hands an feet, an anodda bandage aroun his face. Jesus say, “Hemo da bandage from his face, Jesus Cry an let him go.” Dey Talk How Dey Goin Kill Jesus (Matthew 26:1-5; Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2) 45 Den plenny Jewish peopo dat wen come fo kokua Mary, an wen see all da awe- some stuff Jesus wen do, dey wen trus him.

An he no goin mahke ony fo da Jewish peopo, but fo all Godʼs kids dat stay all ova da world, fo bring dem all togedda Lazarus Come Back Alive fo come one peopo. Dass why, from dat time, da Jewish leada guys wen talk togedda how dey goin kill Jesus. So Jesus no go aroun no moa wea da Jewish leada guys can see him. He go one place near da boonies, Efraim town. An he wen stay ova dea wit da guys he teaching. (Da Census 9:10) 55 Now, almos time fo da Jewish Passova religious time. Plenny peopo from da boonies wen go Jerusalem befo da Passova, so dey can do all da stuff Godʼs Rules say fo do fo make demself clean fo pray Passova time. Da peopo stay looking fo Jesus.

Lazarus 9 Dat time plenny Jewish peopo wen find out dat Jesus was dea inside Betany town, an dey wen come fo see him. An not ony him, but Lazarus too. Cuz dey wen hear dat Jesus wen make Lazarus come back alive from mahke. So da main priest guys wen talk togedda how dey goin kill Lazarus too. Cuz plenny Jewish peopo wen hear bout Lazarus, an see him. Az why dey wen bag dea leadas, an trus Jesus. Jesus Go Inside Jerusalem Jalike One King (Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28- 40; Songs fo God 118:25-26; Zechariah 9:9) 12 Da nex day, plenny peopo dat wen come Jerusalem fo da Passova wen hear dat Jesus stay coming dea.

Den, dey wen rememba dat da Bible wen say all dis tings bout him. An dey wen rememba dat da peopo wen make lidat to him. Now, all da peopo dat wen stay wit Jesus, da time he wen make Lazarus come back alive from mahke, dey wen tell wat dey wen see. Dass why plenny peopo wen go outside Jerusalem fo meet Jesus, cuz dey wen hear bout da awesome ting he wen do dat wen show who him. Den da Pharisee guys tell each odda, “Look! Everybody in da whole world stay going wit Jesus! An us guys no can do notting fo stop um!” Had Greek Guys Dat Like See Jesus 20 Had some Greek guys dat wen go Da Main Priest Guys Talk How Dey Can Kill Jerusalem wit da odda peopo fo da Passova religious time, fo go down an show God love an respeck dea. Dey come by Philip, da guy who come from Betsaida town, Galilee side, an dey tell him, “Eh Mista, us guys, we like meet Jesus.” 22 Philip, he go tell Andrew. Den Andrew an Philip, dey go togedda an tell Jesus. Jesus tell dem, “Time awready fo me, da Guy Dass Fo Real. Now God goin make me come awesome fo real kine! But befo I come awesome, I gotta mahke. An I like tell you guys dis too: I jalike da wheat going cuz dey get da light inside.” seed dat gotta fall down inside da groun an mahke, an den can grow, fo make plenny mo seeds. If da seed no mahke, stay ony one seed. Whoeva like hang on to dea life, dey goin lose um. But whoeva give up dea life in dis world, goin hang on to um, an stay live to da max foeva. Whoeva like be my helpa gotta go wit me an be my guy. Wea I stay, my helpa guy goin stay dea too. An my Fadda goin show respeck to dat helpa guy.” 27 Den Jesus tell, “Right now I feel all funny kine inside. Wat I goin say? ‘Fadda, no let me mahke right now’? No way I goin say dat! Dass why I wen come hea, so I can mahke. I say dis: ‘Fadda, let um happen, so everybody can know how awesome you stay.’ ” Den one voice from da sky wen say, “I wen show dem I stay awesome awready, an I goin show um one mo time.” 29 Da peopo dat wen stand dea an hear um, wen say, “Eh! Get thunder!” Da odda peopo wen say, “Nah, az was one angel messenja guy from da Boss dat wen talk to him.” 30 Jesus tell dem, “Dis voice not fo me, but fo you guys. Now da peopo inside dis world goin stand in front God da Judge, an God goin throw out da Bad Guy dat stay in charge a da peopo all ova da world. Wen dey lift me up from da groun fo kill me, den I goin bring everybody by me.” 33 (He wen say dat fo show dem how he goin mahke.) 34 Da peopo tell him, “We wen hear from Godʼs Rules dat da Christ Guy goin live foeva. Den how come you say, ‘Dey goin take me, da Guy Dass Fo Real, an lift me up from da groun fo kill me’? Who dis Guy Dass Fo Real dat you talking bout?” 35 Jesus wen tell dem, “Me, I jalike da light fo you guys. Ony litto wile mo da light goin stay hea wit you guys.

Jalike da guy Isaiah wen say, dat wen talk fo God long time ago, “Eh Boss! No mo nobody wen trus wat us Jesus Tell How He Goin Mahke guys wen say! Wen you wen show yoa power, no- body see notting!” 39 Az why da Jewish peopo no can trus God nowdays, jalike Isaiah wen say one nodda time, 40 “God wen make um so dey no can see, An make um hard head, So dey no like see wit dea eyes, No like undastan wit dea head, No like change an come by me, Cuz dey no like fo me fo make um come good.” 41 Isaiah wen say dat cuz he wen see how awesome Jesus stay, an he wen tell wat goin happen wit Jesus. Plenny Jewish main leada guys wen trus Jesus, but dey no like tell everybody, cuz dey scared da Pharisee guys goin throw um outa da Jewish church. Cuz da leada guys, dey like da peopo talk good bout dem, mo den dey like God talk good bout um. Wat Jesus Say Show Wat Kine Peopo Dem 44 Jesus wen talk loud an say, “Whoeva trus me, he no trus ony me, but he trus da One dat wen send me hea too. Whoeva see me, he see da One dat wen send me hea too. I wen come jalike da light inside da world, so dat whoeva trus me, dey no goin stay dark inside. Whoeva hear wat I say an no do um, I no goin punish dem. I neva come fo punish da peopo inside da world. Me, I wen come fo take um outa da bad kine stuff dey doing. Whoeva no take me an wat I say, dat guy goin get one nodda judge. In da end time wen da world goin pau, all da stuff I wen say goin show how dat guy stay. Cuz I neva talk by myself, but my Fadda who wen send me wen tell me everyting he like me fo say. I know dat wat da Fadda tell us fo do show everybody how dey can come alive foeva fo real kine. So everyting I say, dass jalike my Fadda wen tell me.” Jesus Wash His Guys Feet 1 Was jus befo da Passova time. Jesus wen know dat was time fo him fo go outa dis world, an go by his Fadda.

No wash ony my feet. Wash my hands an my head too!” 10 Jesus tell him, “Whoeva wen bafe, dey ony need wash dea feet. Dea body stay clean awready. You guys stay clean inside, but not all you guys.” 11 (Cuz Jesus know awready who goin set him up. Dass why he say, “All you guys not clean.”) 12 Afta Jesus wen wash dea feet, he put on his robe an go back to da table. Den he aks um, “Eh, you guys undastan how come I wen wash you guys feet?

An Peter, he wen stand dea too wit da odda guys, fo come warm. Da Head Priest Guy Aks Jesus Plenny Stuff 7 He wen aks dem again, “Who you look- (Matthew 26:59-66; Mark 14:55-64; Luke 22:66-71) Dey tell, “Jesus, da guy from Nazaret.” 19 Den da Head Priest guy aks Jesus bout 8 Jesus tell um, “I wen tell you, I da guy. da guys he wen teach, an wat he teaching 20 Jesus tell him, “I wen talk wea every- body can hear me.

But if was good, how come you wen go slap me?” 24 Den Jesus an da Head Priest Guy Annas wen send him, all tie up, to da Head (Matthew 26:57-58; Mark 14:53-54; Luke 3:2; Priest guy, Kaiafas.

Da guy tell, 27 One mo time Peter wen say, “No way!:1-5) 28 Den da guys dat work fo da Head Priest take Jesus away from Kaiafas place to da Rome army headquarters. Was early in da morning. But dey neva go inside da Rome guys place, cuz if dey do dat, bumbye dey no can eat da spesho food fo da Passova cuz jalike dey pilau. Den Governa Pilate wen go outside wea da Jews stay. He aks dem, “Wat you guys get agains dis guy?” 30 Dey tell him, “If da bugga no was one crook, us guys no goin turn him ova to you.” 31 Den Pilate tell dem, “Take him den an judge him jalike how yoa Rules say you gotta do.” Da priest guys tell Pilate, “Us guys no can fo da Jews!” An dey slap his face wit dea do dat, cuz us guys no mo da right fo kill nobody da Rome way, on top one cross.” 32 Wen dey say dat, da ting Jesus wen say befo wen come true. He wen tell his guys awready dat he goin mahke da Rome way on top one cross. Den Pilate go back inside da army headquarters, an he tell Jesus fo come inside, an tell him, “Eh, you! You da King fo da Jews, o wat?” 34 Jesus tell him, “Dass wat you figga yoaself? O odda peopo wen tell you dat bout me?” 35 Pilate tell, “Me? You tink I one Jew? Dass was yoa own peopo an da main priest guys wen bring you to me. Wat you wen do?” 36 Jesus tell, “I not da kine king from dis world. If I was dat kine king, den my guys goin fight so da Jews no can take me. I one king, but no mo nobody hea inside dis world wen make me one king.” 37 Pilate aks him, “So, you one king den?” Jesus tell him, “You wen say I one king. Az why I wen born, an az why I wen come hea inside da world -- so I can tell everyting “Eh, you! Wea you come from?” But Jesus dat I know bout da true stuff. Everybody dat stick wit da trut, dey listen to me.” 38 Pilate aks him, “Wat da trut?” 23:13-25) Wen Pilate wen say dat, he wen go back outside to da Jews, an he tell dem, “I no find Da Sky let you do all dis, den you can. Dass Jesus an Pilate notting wrong wit dis guy. But you guys (Matthew 27:1-2,11-14; Mark 15:1-5; Luke get dis ting wea I suppose to let one guy go at da Passova time. So, you guys like me let go da King fo da Jews, o wat?” 40 Dey all yell an say, “Not dis guy! We like Barabbas!” Now, Barabbas, he was one mean crook guy. Da Army Guys Take Jesus 1 Den Governa Pilate tell his guys fo take Jesus an cut him up wit da whip. Da army guys wen twist togedda big kine thorn branches fo make one crown, an dey put um on top his head. Den dey put one purple kine robe on top him. An dey coming in front him, an tell, “Hui! King hands. Den Pilate go outside one mo time, an tell everybody, “Eh, look! I goin bring him outside fo you guys, so you guys can know dat I neva find notting wrong fo punish him.” 5 Jesus wen come outside wit da crown a thorns on top his head an da purple robe. Den Pilate tell da peopo, “Look, da guy!” 6 Wen da main priest guys an da police guys see Jesus, dey make big noise, an dey yelling, “Kill him on top one cross! Kill him on top one cross!” Pilate tell um, “You guys take him an kill um on top one cross! I no find notting wrong fo punish him.” 7 Da Jews tell Pilate, “Us guys get Rules from God, an da Rules say dis guy gotta mahke, cuz he wen go talk like he Godʼs Boy.” Governa Pilate Talk To Jesus 8 Wen Governa Pilate hear wat dey wen tell um, he come mo scared. He go back inside da army headquarters an aks Jesus, neva say notting. Den Pilate tell him, “You no like talk to me, o wat? Eh, you donno dat I get da right fo make dem kill Dey Say, Jesus Gotta Mahke you on top one cross, an I get da right fo let (Matthew 27:15-31; Mark 15:6-20; Luke you go?” 11 Jesus tell, “Ony one way you get da right fo hurt me. Ony if God Up Dea Inside why da guy who wen turn me ova to you, he do mo worse ting den you.” 12 From dat time, Pilate try fo let him go. But da Jews make big noise an yell, “If you let dis guy go, you not King Cesarʼs friend. If anybody make himself one king, he agains King Cesar.” 13 So, wen Pilate hear da tings dey say- ing, he bring Jesus outside, an he sit down on top da judge chair by da place dey call “Stone Pavemen Square,” an da Jews call um “Gabbata.” 14 Was da Day Fo Make Ready Fo Da Passova. Bout noon time, Pilate tell da Jews, “Look now, yoa king!” 15 But dey make big noise an yell, “Take um away! Take um away! Kill um on top one cross!” Pilate tell um, “Wot! You mean, yoa king, I gotta kill um?” Da main priest guys tell, “Us guys, we no mo no odda king, ony King Cesar!” 16 Den Pilate turn ova Jesus fo da army guys kill um on top one cross.:26-43) So dey take charge a Jesus, 17 an he wen carry his own cross outside da town, da place dey call “Da Skull Place,” an da Jews call um “Golgota,” dea language. Ova dea dey wen nail Jesus to one cross. Same ting fo two odda guys, one on top one cross on da left side, da odda one on top one nodda cross on da right side, an Jesus inside da middle. One nodda ting: Pilate wen tell da army guys fo make one sign an put um on top da cross. Da sign say, “Jesus from Na aret, da King Fo Da 20 Dis sign, plenny Jews wen read um, cuz da place dey wen kill him stay near Jerusalem town. Da army guys wen write da sign in three language: Hebrew, Greek, an Latin. Da Jewish main priest guys tell Pilate, “Eh, no write, ‘Da King Fo Da Jews’! Mo betta write, ‘Dis guy wen say, I da King fo da Jews’.” 22 Pilate tell um, “I wen tell my guys wat dey wen broke da first guyʼs legs, an den da fo write, an dass how goin stay!” 23 Da army guys, afta dey wen nail Jesus to da cross, dey take his clotheses an make four piles. Was one pile fo every army guy. Had his robe too, dat neva have seam, cuz dey wen weave um from da top an all ova. So dey say, “Mo betta no broke up da robe. We go throw da dice fo um, yeah? Fo find out who goin get um.” Dat was fo make happen jalike da Bible wen say from befo time: “Dey wen split my clotheses. An my robe, dey wen throw da dice fo um.” So dass wat da army guys wen do. Pilate Say Jesus Gotta Mahke Jesus Tell John Fo Take Care Jesus Mudda 25 Had Jesus mudda standing by da cross wit her sista, an Mary, Clopas wife, an Mary from Magdala. Jesus wen see his mudda standing dea, wit one guy he wen teach, da one he get plenny love an aloha fo. (Dass was me, you know.) So Jesus tell his mudda, “Look, Ma, dis yoa boy now.” 27 Den Jesus tell me, “Look! Make like her yoa mudda now.” An I wen take her to my own place from dat time. Jesus Mahke (Matthew 27:45-56; Mark 15:33-41; Luke Dey Wen Nail Jesus to One Cross 23:44-49) (Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; Luke 28 Afta dat, Jesus wen know dat he wen pau do everyting he suppose to do. Den fo make come true everyting da Bible wen say befo time, he say, “I thirsty!” 29 Had one jug full a cheap wine ova dea. Dey fill up one sponge wit dat wine, put um on top one oregano branch, an put um up to his mout. Wen Jesus wen suck da cheap wine he say, “Everyting pau awready!” An he wen bend down his head, an den let go his spirit. Dey Stab Jesus (Outa Egypt 12:46; Da Census 9:12; Songs fo God 34:20; Zechariah 12:10) Jews.” 31 Was da Day Fo Make Everyting Ready Fo Da Passova. Da Jews neva like fo da mahke bodies fo stay on top da cross on da Rest Day. Dat Rest Day stay real spesho, so da leada guys wen go beg Pilate fo broke da guys legs fo kill um mo quick, so dey can take down da bodies. Da army guys wen go dea. Da two guys dey wen kill um on top da odda crosses same time wit Jesus, odda guyʼs legs. But wen dey go by Jesus, dey see dat he mahke awready, so dey neva broke his legs. But one army guy wen stab him wit his spear on da side, an blood an water come out. (You know, one a da guys dat wen see all dat happen, dass me. I tell da tings I wen see, an I tell da trut. I wen bend down, an look inside, an I spock know I telling true kine stuff, so you guys can trus wat I say.) 36 All dis wen happen jalike da Bible wen say befo time, “Dey no goin broke even one bone.” 37 An da Bible wen tell one nodda ting, “Dey goin look at him, da guy dey wen stab.” 23:50-56) 38 Had one guy, name Joseph from Ari- matea. He wen like learn plenny from Jesus, but he neva tell nobody, cuz he scared da Jewish leada guys. He wen go aks Pilate fo let him take Jesus body, an Pilate let him. So he go an take away Jesus body. Nicodemus, he go ova dea wit Joseph too. He da guy who befo time wen go by Jesus, nite time, fo talk to him. He wen bring aloe an myrrh, all mix up, bout hundred pounds, fo put on top Jesus body befo dey bury him. Dey wen take Jesus body an wrap um up inside linen kine cloth wit da aloe an myrrh inside, cuz dass how da Jews bury da mahke guys. Now da place dey wen kill Jesus, had one garden wit trees, an one new place fo bury dat da owna guy jus pau dig outa one cave, an dey neva put nobody inside dea yet. Dass wea dey put Jesus, cuz was da Day Da Jews Make Ready Fo Da Passova, an dat place stay near. Da first day in da week, Mary from Magdala wen come back to da place dey wen bury Jesus. She come dea wen dark time still yet. She wen see da big stone Jesus friends wen use fo close da place afta dey bury um. But now, da stone stay on da side. So she wen run ova dea wea Simon Peter wen stay, an me, da guy dat Jesus get love an aloha fo, I stay dea wit Peter. She wen tell us, “Dey wen take da Boss away! He no stay inside da place dey wen bury um! We donno wea dey wen put him!” 3 So Peter an me wen run, fo go da place. Us guys wen run togedda, but me, I wen run mo fast, an come to da place first. I all da linen kine cloths lying ova dea, da ones dey wen wrap Jesus inside. But I neva go inside da place dey wen bury Jesus. Den Simon Peter come afta. An he go inside da place dey wen bury Jesus, an see da cloths dey use fo wrap Jesus inside fo bury him. Da cloths lying ova dea too. He Dey Bury Jesus see da odda cloth dat was aroun Jesus head, (Matthew 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; Luke all fold up on da odda side. Den me, dat wen come first, I wen go inside too. An I wen see um, an I wen believe wat Jesus wen say befo time, dat he goin come back alive. Cuz us guys still yet neva undastan dat da Bible say Jesus gotta come back alive from mahke. Den us two, Jesus guys, we wen go back da place we staying. Mary From Magdala See Jesus 11 Mary stay outside da place dey wen bury Jesus, an she crying. An wen she was still crying, she wen bend down, an look inside. She wen spock two angel guys wit white clotheses sitting ova dea wea Jesus body wen stay befo, one by wea da head wen stay, an da odda by wea da feet wen stay. Dey tell her, “Lady, how come you stay crying?” She tell dem, “Cuz dey wen take away my Boss, an I donno wea dey wen put um.” 14 Afta she wen say dat, she wen turn aroun an see Jesus standing dea. But she neva know dat was Jesus. Jesus tell her, “Lady, how come you 20 stay crying? Who you looking fo?” She wen tink he da yard man, an she tell Jesus Come Back Alive him, “Mista, if you wen take him away, tell (Songs fo God 16:9-10) me wea you wen put him, an I goin take da body fo bury.” 16 Jesus say, “Eh, Mary!” She wen turn aroun an say, “Rab- boni!” Dass how da Jewish peopo say, “Eh, Teacha!” 17 Jesus tell her, “No touch me, cuz I neva go up by my Fadda yet. But go by my brudda an sista guys an tell dem, I goin go up dea by my Fadda an yoa Fadda, an by my God an yoa God.” 18 Den Mary from Magdala wen go an tell his guys, “Eh!

Was da same day Sunday, da first day trus him, you guys goin live foeva fo real in da week, an da sun wen go down.

Plenny times I wen go from one Jewish church to da odda fo punish um, an I wen try fo make um talk stink agains God.

We all wen fall down on top da groun, an I wen hear one voice dat wen talk in local talk, ‘Saul, Saul, why you make me suffa?

Dey wen go outa da room, an wen tell each odda, “Dis guy neva do notting wrong dat say he gotta mahke o go jail.” 32 An Agrippa wen tell Festus, “If dis guy neva aks fo stand in front da Big King Cesar, close by da Crete coast. afta litto wile one we wen let him go.” 1 Da leadas say we goin sail Italy side, an dey wen hand ova Paul an some odda prisona guys to one captain name Julius from Cesarʼs army guys. We wen go inside one boat from Adramytium dat stay ready fo sail da port towns on da Asia coast, an we ropes good aroun da big boat fo hold um wen go out on da ocean. Aristarkus from Macedonia, Tessalonika side, wen go wit us. Da nex day we wen come Sidon, an we wen go on top da land. Julius wen like do someting good fo Paul, an he wen let um go by his friends so dey can take care him. We wen go from ova dea out on da ocean again an wen pass near Cyprus Island on da leeward side, cuz da wind wen blow agains us. We wen sail da deep ocean by da Cilicia an Pamfylia coast, an wen come Myra, Lycia side, an wen go on top da land. Ova dea da captain wen find one boat from Alexandria dat stay going Italy side, an he wen put us on top um. Plenny days we wen go slow, an had hard time fo come by Knidus Island. Da wind neva let us go da way we like, so we wen sail by Crete Island, leeward side, unda Salmone Head. We wen get hard time wen we wen go by da coast side. An we wen come by one place dey wen call “Safe Harbor” near Lasea town. We wen lose plenny time, an da Spesho Day Fo Pray An No Eat wen come awready. Da ocean wen stay too rough fo sail dat time. So Paul wen tell um, 10 “Eh, you guys. We betta not sail. I can see dat bumbye we goin get rough time. We goin lose da boat an all da stuffs, an all us too.” 11 But tell me. But da boat goin get bus up on da captain neva like listen to Paul. He wen do wat da pilot an da boat owna say. Dat port town no stay good fo da winta time, an almos all da guys wen tink mo betta fo go. Jesus Guys 27:28 near one land. Dey wen drop one line an wen find out dat da water stay one hundred an twenty feet deep. Afta litto wile dey wen find out dat da water stay ninety feet deep. Dey wen come scared dat da wind goin pound us agains da rocks, an dey wen put down four anchors from da stern an wen pray dat da day time can come fast. Da sailor guys wen try fo escape from da boat, an wen put da litto boat down inside da ocean. Dey wen ack like dey putting down da anchors from da front a da big boat. Den Paul wen tell da captain an da army guys, “If dese guys no stay by da boat, you no goin come outa dis.” 32 So da army guys wen cut da ropes fo da litto boat an wen let da litto boat go. Jus befo da sun wen come up, Paul wen beg da guys fo eat. He say, “Fourteen days you guys wen wait, an you neva eat notting. Now I beg you guys fo eat someting. You need um fo stay alive. You guys no goin lose even one hair from yoa head.” 35 Wen he wen say dat, he wen take some bread an wen tank God in front all dem. Den he wen broke um an wen start fo eat. Dat wen kokua dem, an dey all wen eat. (Had two hundred seventy-six guys on top da boat.) 38 Wen dey wen eat all da stuff dey wen like, house. We wen stay dea fo three days, an dey wen throw da grain inside da ocean an wen make da boat mo light. Wen da sun wen come up, dey neva know da land wea dey was. But dey wen spock one bay an one sandy beach. Dey wen tink stay mo betta fo make da boat eat it ova dea. Dey wen cut da ropes fo da anchors an wen leave um inside da ocean. Same time dey wen hemo da ropes from da ruddas. Den dey wen raise all da sails in front to da wind an wen steer um to da beach. But da boat wen hit one side current. Da front wen come stuck an no can move. Da back wen come all bus up cuz da surf wen pound um. Da army guys wen like kill da prisona guys so dat dey no can swim away an escape. But da captain wen like take Paul outa dea alive, so he neva let um. He wen tell da guys dat can swim fo jump ova inside da ocean first an swim to da land. He wen tell da odda guys fo hang on da boards o da pieces from da boat. Dass how all da Jesus Guys 28:16 dey wen come to da Appius Market an da Three Taverns fo meet us. Wen Paul wen spock dem, dat wen kokua him, an he wen tank God. We wen go inside Rome, an dey wen let Paul stay inside one place by himself, an one army guy wen guard um. Afta three days Paul wen tell da leadas fo da Jewish peopo fo come. Wen dey wen come, Paul wen tell um, “My bruddas, I neva do notting agains our peopo o agains our ancesta guys ways. But dey wen bus me inside Jerusalem an hand me ova to da Rome guys. Da Rome guys wen aks me plenny stuffs, an dey wen like let me go, cuz I neva do notting dat say I gotta mahke. But da Jewish guys neva like dem fo let me go, so den, I wen say I gotta come in front da Big King Cesar. But I no mo notting fo poin finga at my peopo. So I wen tell dese guys I like talk to you. I trus God dat he fo tell um, an nobody wen try make him goin take da Israel peopo outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in. Dass why dey wen tie me up wit dis chain.” 21 Da Jewish guys wen say, “We neva get no lettas from Judea bout you. An da bruddas dat wen come from ova dea neva say notting stink bout you. But we like listen to wat you say. We know dat da peopo all ova da place stay talking agains dis stuff you teach.” 23 Den dey wen say dey goin come togedda one spesho day. An dat time even mo peopo wen come to da place wea Paul stay. Wen da sun come up till da sun go down he wen tell um all da stuff bout how dey can get God fo dea King. He wen try help um fo trus da Good Stuff Bout Jesus. He start wit da stuff Moses wen write down inside da Rules, an den he talk bout da odda guys dat wen talk fo God befo time. Some guys wen trus da Good Stuff Paul wen tell um, but da odda guys neva like trus um. Dey wen go way an make argue wit each odda. But first Paul wen say, “Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen tell yoa ancesta guys da trut! Isaiah wen talk fo him 26 an say, ‘God wen tell me fo go by dis peopo an say, “You guys goin hear, You guys goin see, Fo Da Rome Peopo 1:1 1 Dis letta from me, Paul.

He know 18 One mo ting God wen let us undastan: I stay work fo him hundred percent wit my Da peopo ack jalike God no matta, an dey spirit. I make like dis fo tell da peopo all do da kine tings dey not suppose to do. But da Good Kine Stuff Bout His Boy. An God God no take wat dey do. Az why he goin Fo Da Rome Peopo 1:19 judge um from up dea in da sky. Inside dem, dey know wass true, but dey stay do da kine tings dey not suppose to do. Az how dey no let da odda peopo know wass true. Dey no mo excuse, cuz everyting dat peopo can know bout God, ony easy fo dem fo undastan, az why. God, he wen show dem awready. Dis wat I mean: From befo time wen God wen make da world, anybody dat try fo undastan da stuffs God wen make, dey can figga how God stay, no matta no can see God. You know, God get dis unreal power dat goin stay lidat foevas. By how he make, he stay God fo shua. An dey can undastan all dat, dose guys. Az why dey no mo excuse fo how dey make. Dey know bout God, but dey no like tell him, “Eh, you stay awesome, cuz you stay God!” Dey no like tell um “Mahalo plenny!” Dass why wat dey stay tinking, all poho awready. Cuz dey no undastan notting, jalike everyting come all dark inside dea heart. Dey tell, “Me, I one akamai guy dat ev- everytime stay huhu wit God. Dey tink dey erytime know wat fo do!” Dey ony tink dat, but you know, dey still yet stupid. Dey no like stick wit da God who everytime awesome an no goin come poho bumbye. But dese guys, dey tink lidis: “We no like dat kine God! Mo betta we stick wit one idol kine god dat look jalike one guy, no matta bumbye he goin come poho. O mo betta our god goin look jalike one bird o one lizard o one nodda animal.” 24 Cuz da way dey acking, dass why God wen let um go do wat dey like. He let um do all da kine pilau kine stuff, cuz dass how dey like do inside dea hearts. Dass why dey no mo shame notting, how dey make any kine wit dea own bodies wit odda peopo. Dem guys, dey hear da true stuffs from God, but dey no like listen. Dey tink lidis: “Mo betta we go do da odda stuff, no matta bulai!” Dey show respeck to all da stuffs God wen make, an dey do all da kine religious stuff fo um, but da One who make everyting, dey no like give love an respeck to him. I stay talking bout God. Eh, he all right! Can talk good bout him every time! Az right! An dass why God wen let dem guys do all dat, an dey ony go do how dey like Fo Da Rome Peopo 2:4 an you doing da same ting, you tink God goin let you go? God get plenny good heart fo you, an he stay hanging in dea an waiting fo you. An den, you make like dass notting? You no undastan dat he like you come sorry an pau do all da bad kine stuff you guys doing? But you get hard head, an you no like change how you stay doing. So, you stay making tings mo worse fo yoaself. Bumbye God da Judge goin tell who wen do da bad kine stuff, an everybody goin know dat wat God say stay true. Den he goin punish you, cuz he no goin take wat you wen do. How you make, same ting, God goin give you back. God goin give some peopo da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva, cuz everytime still yet need one teacha. Cuz you get Godʼs dey hang in dea an do da right ting. Dey like get plenny respeck from God, an get da real kine life. But da odda peopos, God no goin take wat dey do. He goin had it wit dem awready, cuz dey like make big kine trouble. Dey no like do da true stuff, but dey everytime like do wass wrong. Everybody dat stay doing da bad kine stuff goin get hard time how dey living, an dey goin suffa plenny presha. First goin be da Jewish peopo. Den goin be da odda peopos dat not Jews. But everybody dat stay doing da good kine stuff, God goin give dem plenny respeck, an dea hearts goin rest inside. First goin be da Jewish peopo. Den da odda peopos dat not Jews. God make um everybody da same ting. Everybody dat do bad kine stuff, an dey neva know dat God wen make Rules fo everybody, dey goin get cut off from God, no matta dey donno dat Godʼs Rules stay. An everybody dat do da bad kine stuff, an dey know Godʼs Rules stay, God goin use da Rules fo judge dem. Fo get um right wit God, no nuff fo ony hear Godʼs Rules. Gotta do jalike Godʼs Rules say, fo get um right wit him. Da peopo dat not Jews, dey donno dat Godʼs Rules stay. But if get peopo dat by demself do jalike Godʼs Rules say, but dey donno dat da Rules stay, den dey stay ack jalike dey get um. How dey ack, dass jalike dey get Godʼs Rules right dea inside dea heart. Dea heart tell dem bout wat dey Fo Da Rome Peopo 3:1 charge da guy, an dass jalike one spesho mark inside his heart. Da Rules inside one book, dass not wat make him Godʼs kid. Az not da peopo dat goin talk good bout him, goin be God dat goin do um. Rules 1 So den, how come mo betta fo be one Jewish guy? You tink da Jewish guy who get da cut skin mark get mo spesho tings den da guy dat not Jew? Az right! Help um plenny fo do everyting. First, cuz God wen give da Jewish peopo all da stuffs he wen tell um, an he wen tell um fo take care all dat. So den, wat? You tink dat God no can do wat he wen say he goin do, jus cuz get some Jewish peopo dat neva like trus him? Not! God everytime da real ting, no matta everybody dat stay all ova da world all bulaias! Jalike da Bible say bout God, “Da peopo goin find out No matta dey say dat he do wrong, 5 But if we do da wrong tings, an dat goin show everybody even mo dat God stay doing da right tings, den wat we goin say bout dat? We goin say God do wrong wen he punish us, o wat? (Dass how some peopo stay talking, you know.) 6 No way! God no do da wrong kine stuff notting wen he punish us. Dass why he get da right fo punish da peopo inside da world wen dey do da wrong kine stuff. If I go bulai, an dat show everybody even mo dat God tell da trut, an he stay awesome, den how come God say was bad, da ting I wen do? Even get some peopo dat stay talking stink bout us an tell odda peopo dat we say, “Eh, we go do da bad kine stuff, so den everyting goin come good!” God goin do da right ting wen he punish da peopo dat tink lidat! time 143:2; Proverbs 1:6; Ecclesiastes 7:20; Isaiah 59:7- um right wit him wen we trus Jesus Christ, 8) Fo Da Rome Peopo 3:23 fo everybody dat trus him, no mo notting diffren. Cuz everybody do bad kine stuff. Dasshe can go talk big bout dat. But in front God why nobody can come awesome by dem- self, da way God like make um come awe- some. But can get um right wit God, cuz “Abraham wen trus God, God get good heart an like do plenny good stuff fo peopo. God cut um loose from da power da bad kine stuff get ova dem, cuz dey tight wit Jesus Christ. God wen make Jesus da main guy, so dass wat da boss owe um. God da One dat he can be da sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff everybody do, ony da one dat get um right wit him, no matta if dey go trus him an dey shua dat he wen dey neva care bout God befo time. No can go bleed an mahke fo dem. Dass how God show dat he make everyting come right: he trus God, an den God goin say dat you stay let um go fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do right. befo time an hemo dea shame. You know, befo time God neva push hard fo peopo fo peopo goin stay good inside wen God say pau do da bad kine stuff. Nowdays, fo show dat dey get um right wit him, an dey neva everybody dat he everytime do da right ting, he make everybody dat trus Jesus get 7 “Da peopo dat wen broke Godʼs Rules, um right wit him. So, wat? How come you tink you can An wen hemo dea shame. talk big now? No can! Wot?! You tell how you get one Rule dat say, you get um right Da peopo dat wen do da bad kine stuffs, wit God cuz you wen do good kine stuffs? Eh, not even! We can ony tell bout dat Rule dat say we get um right wit God cuz we trus um. So dis wat we figga: Anybody can get um right wit God wen dey trus him, not wen dey ony do da stuff Godʼs Rules say. cut skin mark, dey da ony ones can stay 29 Kay den. God, he ony fo da Jewish peopo? You tink he not God fo da peopo dat not Jews? Fo shua, he God fo dem too! Abraham wen trus God, an cuz a dat, God 30 Cuz ony get one God. Da guys dat get da cut skin mark fo show dey Jewish kine, dat? Was wen Abraham get da cut skin God make um so dey get um right wit him cuz dey trus him. An da peopo dat not Jews he neva say dat afta he wen get um, but an no mo da mark on top dem, he make dem so dey get um right wit him cuz dey trus him too. You tink dat wen we trus God, dat mean we make Godʼs Rules poho? No way! We make da Rules mo solid. So den, Abraham, da ancesta guy dat us stay jalike da fadda fo da Jewish guys dat Jewish peopo all come from, wat we get fo get da mark too. But not jus cuz dey get say bout wat wen happen to him? Fo Da Rome Peopo 4:13 Abraham wen trus um, befo he wen get da fo us guys too. God goin figga we get um cut skin mark. God wen promise Abraham an da peopo dat goin come from him afta, dat to. An den, he wen come alive again fo bumbye dey goin own da whole world. God make us guys get um right wit God. wen say dat cuz Abraham wen trus God, an get um right wit him. But God neva say dat Abraham goin get um jus cuz he do wat da Rules say. You know, da peopo dat ony like stick wit Godʼs Rules, if dey wen get wat God heart stay clear inside wit God awready, wen promise jus cuz a dat, den az no mean cuz our Boss Jesus, da Spesho Guy God Wen notting fo trus God, an poho da promise Send, he wen make um good fo everybody. God wen make. Weaevas get Godʼs Rules, 2 Christ wen make um so we can come tight goin get peopo who goin broke um, an God wit God an get all da good stuff he like do no goin take it. Weaeva Godʼs Rules no stay, fo us, cuz we wen trus him first. An dass no mo nobody goin broke um. Dass why you betta trus him. God inside cuz we stay shua dat bumbye God like do plenny good tings fo da peopo who goin make us come awesome jalike him. trus him. Dass how we know dat Godʼs promise stay fo shua fo all us guys who we goin feel good inside, cuz we know, dat come from Abraham. Not da peopo dat hard time goin make um so we can hang in get Godʼs Rules ony, but da peopo dat same dea mo betta. Wen we hang in dea, dat time trus God, jalike Abraham. cuz he jalike make us mo solid. Wen we mo solid, den we da fadda fo all us guys. God wen say stay shua dat bumbye God goin do plenny inside da Bible, “I wen make you da fadda fo fo us. Wen we stay shua dat God goin do plenny diffren kine peopos.” Fo shua God um fo us, we no need worry notting. Cuz goin make dat promise solid, an God, he da God give us his Good an Spesho Spirit, fo One dat Abraham wen trus. God make da make us feel inside our heart how much peopo come back alive afta dey mahke. He plenny he get love an aloha fo us. ony gotta say someting fo make someting dass fo real come from notting. Abraham wen trus God an wen wait ack jalike God no matta. Dass da time God fo him, even wen he neva see notting wen pick. Eh you know, nobody goin coming from God. Dass how he wen come mahke fo one guy dat ony do right kine “da fadda fo plenny diffren kine peopos,” stuff! If get one guy dat everytime get good jalike da Bible wen say, “Goin get plenny heart, maybe bumbye somebody go mahke peopo come from you.” 19 Abrahamʼs trus fo help dat kine guy. But den God wen was strong fo God, no matta he figga, his show how plenny love an aloha he get fo body litto mo ready fo mahke, cuz he near us, cuz same time we was doing bad kine hundred year old, an Sarah, she no can stuff, Christ still yet wen go mahke fo us. come hapai awready. Abraham neva tink dat God no can do um, an den pau trus God. cuz Christ wen bleed an mahke fo us. God His trus fo God wen stay solid, cuz he know no take da bad kine stuff peopo stay doing, how awesome God stay. Abraham wen but cuz a Christ, us guys no goin suffa. know fo shua dat wateva God wen promise, he strong nuff fo give um. So dass why den Godʼs Own Boy wen mahke so we can God wen figga dat Abraham get um right go da same side wit God. So now we da wit him. Wen da Bible say how God figga dat, take us outa da bad kine stuff we doing, cuz he no say dat ony fo Abraham, 24 he say um he wen come back alive again. An dass Fo Da Rome Peopo 5:12 not all! We like tell dat God stay awesome, cuz we stay tight wit him. An we stay tight wit him, cuz our Boss Jesus Christ wen mahke fo us, so now we can go da same side wit God. Diffren 12 So den, from da start befo time, da first man Adam, he da one wen start fo do da bad kine stuff. Az why God neva let um live foeva. An from dat time, all da peopo inside da world make jalike dat man. Cuz dey make lidat, same ting jalike dat man, dey all gotta mahke. Befo time, wen still yet neva have da Rules from God, all ova da world had peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But wen neva have da Rules, nobody wen go write down wat da bad kine stuff peopo do. Everybody from Adam till Moses time gotta mahke fo shua, no matta dey neva do da same ting dat God wen tell Adam fo no do. Still yet, dey wen do odda kine bad stuff. Az why dey gotta mahke jalike Adam. You know, Adam an Jesus, dem two da same, but den dey diffren. Az Adam da one, he jalike one picha fo show Jesus, da One dat goin show up bumbye. Da bad kine stuff dat Adam wen do, dass notting like da good kine stuff Jesus wen do fo us. Had da one guy Adam, dat wen go do wat God tell um not fo do, an cuz a dat, everybody wen mahke. But den da odda guy, Jesus Christ, eh, he do plenny good kine stuffs fo us, an he neva expeck notting back from nobody. Dass nuff fo everybody, cuz God everytime like do plenny fo us. Eh, da ting dat God wen give us guys, dass mo betta fo everybody den da bad ting dat da one guy Adam wen do. Afta he wen do dat, God da Judge say, “Gotta punish um!” But even afta da peopo wen go blow it choken times, jalike God da Judge give um one spesho present -- he tell, “Now, can get um right wit me!” 17 So den, da one guy Adam, wen go do one ting dat he not suppose to do. Cuz a dat, now everybody gotta mahke. An now, da one guy Jesus Christ wen do one real good ting, an dass mo betta fo us guys. Now, us guys get um right wit God. Dass jalike one present he give us. An he goin Fo Da Rome Peopo 6:6 come back alive from mahke jalike Jesus wen come back alive. We know dat da no good kine guy we was befo, pau awready, jalike dat guy wen mahke on top da cross wit Christ. Now dat no good kine guy no mo power. Now we no need do da bad kine stuff. Now we not stuck -- we not slave guys. Afta one guy mahke, no mo notting dat can make um do bad kine stuff no moa. So den, jalike we wen mahke wit Christ. Dass why we believe dat we goin stay live wit him too. We know dat Christ wen come back alive afta he wen mahke, an he no goin mahke again. Cuz no mo notting dat get power fo make him mahke one mo time. Afta Christ wen mahke dat one time, den he no mo notting fo do wit da bad kine stuff no moa. Now he ony live fo God. So den, you guys gotta figga same ting pilau kine stuff an dat gotta go broke da jalike wat wen happen wit Jesus Christ: You guys wen mahke awready, dass why you guys no gotta do da bad kine stuff. Same time, you guys live fo God, cuz now you guys stay tight wit Jesus Christ. No let da bad kine stuff take ova you, an make you do any kine stuff yoa body like. Dat body goin mahke, you know. An no go let notting inside you go do stuff dat ting you guys wen get from all dat stuff no stay right, cuz dass bad. Jus let God make you do wat he like. Cuz jalike you wen go mahke awready an now you stay alive again. Use yoa whole body fo do da kine stuff you suppose to do, fo God. No way! No let da bad kine stuff take you guys ova! Now, fo get um right wit God, you guys no gotta do wat da Rules say. Now, da way you guys live, you stay do wat you do cuz God wen do so plenny good stuffs fo you guys. So, wat? You tink we still yet can stay you not suppose to do, den you cut yoaself doing bad kine stuff, jus cuz we no need do wat da Rules say fo get um right wit God, an God still yet goin do plenny good kine stuff fo us? No way! Fo shua, you guys gotta know dis: If you let one guy own you, you gotta listen to wateva da guy tell you, an den you gotta do um. Dat mean, dat guy yoa boss, an you his slave. Same ting, you can pick wat you goin do. You can let yoaself be one slave guy fo do ony bad kine tan how da Rules stay. I like tell you guys stuff. But wen you pick dat one, you goin dis: from all da time you stay alive, da Rules Fo Da Rome Peopo 7:2 get power ova you. But afta you mahke, da Rules no mo power ova you. Da Rules say, if get one wahine dat stay married to one guy, she gotta stick wit da guy da whole time he stay alive. But if da husban mahke, den she no need do wat da Rules fo da husban an da wife say. If she go live wit one nodda guy, an her husban alive still yet, dass mean she one wahine dat fool aroun behind her husbanʼs back. But den, if her husban stay mahke, den da Rules fo da husban an da wife no mo notting fo do wit her no moa. An if she go marry one nodda guy, dat mean she no go fool aroun behind her mahke husbanʼs back. Same ting wit you guys, my bruddas an sistas! Christ wen go mahke, his body, everyting. Same ting jalike you guys wen mahke awready, so now da Rules no mo notting fo do wit you guys. Dass why now you guys can come his guys, an stay tight wit dis guy Christ dat wen come back alive afta he wen mahke. All dis jalike dat wahine can marry one nodda guy now, an no mo problem. So now, wat you do an how you ack, everyting fo God. Befo time, us guys wen ony like do da kine bad stuff our bodies wen like do. Cuz we wen know da Rules, we wen like go agains um, an dat ony wen make us guys da kine peopo dat do wat we not suppose to. From dat, wat we wen do an how we wen ack dat time, everyting was fo cut us guys off from God. Befo time we gotta do wat da Rules say. Now we no need, cuz jalike we wen mahke awready. Da old way, da Rules inside da Bible neva let us go. But da new way, us guys get Godʼs Spirit in charge a us! den I know dat da Rules stay good. Cuz Az why us guys can work fo God now. So den, wat mo we can say? good, o wat? Not even! If I neva undastan da Rules, den no way I go undastan wat kine stuff stay bad inside me. Jalike I neva know I not suppose to like get odda peopoʼs stuffs fo myself, if da Rules neva say, “No like get odda peopoʼs stuffs fo yoaself.” 8 But cuz da Rules wen say dat, den dass jalike da bad kine stuff inside me wen make me like get all kine stuffs fo myself. If neva have da Rules, da bad kine stuff no mo power ova peopo. Fo Da Rome Peopo 7:24 get one diffren kine rule inside me dat everytime jam me up. Da way I tink, I like do wat stay good, but I no can. Jalike da bad kine rule stay inside my body, an stay make me one prisona dat jus gotta go do any kine bad kine stuff. Auwe! I stay all sore inside! Jalike no mo nobody dat can take me outa da bad kine stuff befo all dat go cut me off from God! But you know wat? God, he da One dat can get me outa dat! Mahalo plenny to God cuz our Boss Jesus Christ can do um! So dis how I stay: My own self, I stuck. No matta my head like do everyting Godʼs Rules say fo do -- da way I stay inside, jalike get one nodda rule dat say I gotta do bad kine stuff. Wit Godʼs Spirit 1 So den, God no goin punish da peopo dat stay tight wit Jesus Christ! Cuz get two tings dat stay fo real: First ting, if you stick you guys. You guys spirits stay alive fo real wit Godʼs Spirit, he goin make you come alive fo real kine an make you stay tight wit Jesus Christ. Da odda ting is dat if you stick wit da bad kine stuff, you goin cut yoaself off from God. Now, if you get Godʼs Spirit, Godʼs Spirit cut you loose from da bad kine stuff. Even if we do wat da Rules from God say, dat no can throw out da bad kine stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys stay, we not strong inside. But den God, he wen go send his own Boy fo come one guy jalike us. Da way Jesus wen stay, God wen make him look jalike one regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff, jalike all da odda peopo. But den, Jesus neva do bad kine stuff -- how he wen live, he wen show proof dat da tings da peopo was doing was bad fo shua. Plus, he wen come one sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff dat all da odda peopo wen do. God wen send Christ fo mahke so us guys can do all da right kine stuffs Godʼs Rules say we gotta do. Now, we stay doing da kine stuff Godʼs Spirit like us do, not da kine stuff we do wen we live da way we like. Da peopo dat live da way dey like, dey live lidat cuz dass how dey stay inside, an dass da ony kine stuff dey tinking bout all da time. But da peopo dat live da way Godʼs Fo Da Rome Peopo 8:16 know you stay Godʼs kids! Dass why he goin listen wen we yell out, “Daddy!” 16 Jalike our own spirit tell us inside, Godʼs Spirit tell us we Godʼs kids. Cuz us guys Godʼs kids, dat mean, we goin get all da good kine stuff God goin give his kids, cuz he our Fadda. Jalike da Fadda give everyting he get to Christ, his Boy, an dass how he goin make to us guys, same time he give um to Christ. Ony one ting: us guys gotta suffa jalike Christ wen suffa, so den bumbye, God make us come awesome jalike he wen make Christ come awesome. You know, I figga dat da stuff we stay suffa right now, az notting! Cuz da awesome stuff God goin show us bumbye, dat goin be unreals! All da tings dat God wen make, jalike dey ony stay watching real hard, cuz dey waiting fo see wen God goin show everybody he proud who his kids stay. All da tings God wen make, he wen figga, first, everyting gotta come all hamajangs an stay lidat. Not suppose to be lidat, an God know fo shua dat bumbye he goin make all dat stuff come okay one mo time. Right now, all da tings dat God wen make, dey stay stuck hamajang kine, an stay coming all pilau kine. But bumbye, God goin do awesome tings fo get um outa dat, so dey can come jalike suppose to be. Same time, God goin do awesome tings fo get all his kids outa da pilau kine stuff too. Us guys know, from befo time till now, all da tings God wen make stay making noise jalike dey get big pain, jalike wen one wahine goin born one baby an she stay suffa plenny. Eh, us guys too, no matta we get da Spirit in charge a us dat God wen give us first ting, jalike we still yet make big to da max! noise inside us lidat too. We make lidat cuz we still yet waiting an watching real hard fo da time wen God goin make us his kids to da max, an goin hemo loose our bodies from all da pilau kine stuff. Wen God wen take us outa da bad kine stuff, he wen make us know fo shua wat he goin do bumbye. But still yet, we gotta wait. If we see someting happen, den we no goin wait fo dat same ting fo happen. Nobody goin stay wait fo someting dat wen pau happen awready. But wen we stay Fo Da Rome Peopo 8:35 35 You tink get somebody o someting dat goin make Christ no get love an aloha fo us guys? No way! You tink presha, hard time, o wen get somebody dat like hurt us, o wen no mo notting fo eat, o no mo clotheses, o wen we scared, o wen we get peopo dat like kill us? Not even! Jalike da Bible wen say, “Cuz we yoa peopo, Everytime dey try kill us. Dey tink we jalike sheeps dey goin kill.” 37 Cuz Christ get love an aloha fo us guys to da max, no matta wat kine trouble get, no bodda us, cuz we da winnas fo shua! I shua bout dis: No mo notting can make God stop loving us guys. No matta if we stay alive o we mahke, no matta if get angel guys o leada guys in da sky, o if get spirits wit power dat go agains us, no matta wateva stay happen now o goin happen bumbye, 39 no matta get guys wit power up dea inside da sky, o down dea inside da groun, no matta get all kine odda kine tings dat God wen make -- no mo notting dat can hemo us from God, so he no love us no moa! Cuz us guys stay tight wit Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, an he our Boss.; Da Rules Second Time 32:4; Outa Egypt 33:19; 9:16) 1 Eh, I no bulai you guys, I ony tell da trut cuz I stay tight wit Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. Same ting my heart tell me, you know, an Godʼs Spirit stay in charge a my heart. I tell you guys dis: Inside, my heart stay plenny sore, an no can stop hurting. My heart stay lidat, cuz I feel fo my own peopo. I like my own peopo, da Jews, come tight wit Christ too. Fo dem, I like even go aks God fo punish me, an not dem, an cut me loose from Christ, so dat my peopo can come tight wit Christ. Dey da Israel peopo. God wen make dem his own kids from befo time. He wen show dem how awesome he stay. He wen make all kine deals wit dem. He wen give um his Rules. Dey da ones dat know how fo go down in front him an show him respeck how suppose to. God wen promise fo do plenny good kine stuffs fo dem. Da Jewish peopo wen come from our ancesta Fo Da Rome Peopo 9:18 Pharaoh inside Egypt. He say, “I wen make you King, cuz I wen like use you fo show how strong I stay, an fo make peopo all ova da world tell wat kine God me!” 18 So den, if God like give one guy chance, dass wat he do. An if he like make one guy hard head, az wat he do too. Any Kine 1:9; 10:22-23; 29:16; 45:9; Jeremiah 18:6; Hosea 1:10; 2:23) 19 Now, somebody goin aks me dis: “Eh! No matta God goin take ony litto bit peopo If dass how stay, how come God still yet poin finga peopo? Cuz no mo nobody can go agains wat God like fo happen, you know.” come you talk back lidat to God, brudda? He no goin wase time notting!” Jalike da Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat making one ting, da ting no can tell da guy, “Good ting, God, da Boss Fo All Da Armies, ‘Eh! How come you wen make me lidis?’ ” 21 Da guy dat make pots, he get da right If he neva do dat, our blood pau, fo use da clay fo make spesho kine pots. O if he like, he goin use da same kine clay fo make pots fo put junk kine stuff inside. Same ting wit God. He like show everybody dat he no take any kine stuff da peopo like do. He like make shua every- body know he get plenny power. Fo show dat, fo long time he put up wit any kine Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um right stuff from da peopo dat do da kine stuff he wit God befo time. Now, dey get um right no take. But dose peopo dat make lidat, ony ready fo get wipe out. An he wen do dat cuz he like show dat he goin give chance to some peopo. Dey da ones dat he wen make ready fo come awesome. He like make shua everybody know dat he stay awesome to da God? Cuz dey wen ony try get um by da max. An you know wat? Us guys, we da stuff dey wen do, but dey neva have trus fo peopo he wen tell dis: “Eh! Come wit me! God. Da Bible wen talk bout one “rock dat Be my guys!” Some a us guys come from make peopo trip ova an fall down.” Dis wat da Jewish kine peopo, an he wen tell us fo Isaiah wen say inside da Bible: come. Odda guys, dey come from da odda “Eh! Right hea inside Zion Town, dass kine peopos. Jalike God wen say befo time inside Hoseaʼs book inside da Bible, “Get peopo dat not my peopo, Goin get one nation dat I neva have love fo, 26 Hosea wen say dis too: “Right dea, Fo Da Rome Peopo 10:1 1 Bruddas an sistas, you know wat I like happen fo da Israel peopo? I aks God plenny fo dem, so dat da Israel peopo goin let God hemo dem from da bad kine stuff dey stay doing. Wen dat happen, dass wen I goin feel real good inside my heart! You know, I can tell you dis bout dese peopo: Dey like go all out fo God, an dey try make lidat, but den, dey donno da main stuff dat dey suppose to know first. Dey donno wat God wen do awready fo all us guys get um right wit him. So dey go try fo get um right wit God how dey like, an dass why dey no like listen to him. Christ wen do everyting fo us get um right wit God. Wit ony da Rules, no can do dat. Now, whoeva go trus Christ, dey da ones dat goin get um right wit God. Stuff Dey Stay Doing 14; Isaiah 28:16 5 Now Moses, he wen go write inside da Bible how fo get um right wit God if da peopo do everyting wat da Rules say. Dis wat Moses wen say: “Whoeva go do everyting da Rules say, cuz dey do dat, dey goin get life fo real kine.” 6 Da Bible say someting diffren den dat too, bout how you get um right wit God cuz you trus him. Da Bible say: “No good you go tink inside yoa head, ‘Eh, who going up dea inside da sky?’ ” Eh, dass jalike da guy going up dea fo tell da Spesho Guy God Wen Send dat we like him come back down hea by us guys. Same ting, da Bible say: “No good you tink inside yoa head, ‘Who goin go way down inside da groun by da Deep Dark Hole wea da mahke peopo stay?’ ” Eh dass jalike da guy going down dea fo bring Christ back from mahke. But you know, da Bible say, “Da main ting God wen say, stay right dea. Awready stay inside yoa mout an inside yoa heart.” Dass da same ting us guys stay teaching: Eh, gotta trus Christ! Dat mean, if you talk strait wit yoa own mout, “Jesus, he my Boss,” an you trus deep inside yoa heart dat God wen bring Christ back alive afta he wen mahke, den God goin hemo you from da bad kine stuff you stay doing. Cuz az Fo Da Rome Peopo 10:20 20 Isaiah wen come strong fo tell um strait inside da Bible dat God wen say, “Da peopo dat no look fo me, I even wen show myself 21 But da Israel peopo, dis wat he wen say bout dem: “All day I wen put out my hands, But dey no like listen. So den, I like aks dis: God wen no like his peopo no moa, o wat? Not even! Me, I from dat same Israel peopo! I get da same blood jalike Abraham, an I get da same blood jalike Benjamin, cuz Abraham Benjaminʼs great granfadda. No, God neva say he no like his peopo no moa. Dey da ones he wen pick from befo time. You no rememba wat da Bible wen say bout Elijah? Da guy Elijah, he was aksing real hard fo God fo do someting agains da Israel peopo. He tell: “Eh Boss! Da guys you wen send fo talk fo Da altar wea dey make sacrifice fo you, Me, I da ony guy dat talk fo you But den, dey still yet stay trying fo kill me 4 An wat God wen say to him? He say dis: “I still get 7,000 guys dat stay my guys. Dey fo talk fo him. Dis job God give me stay no go down in front da idol kine god Baal!” 5 Nowdays, same ting -- get some peopo dat God wen pick jus cuz he like do somet- ing good fo um an give um chance. Fo shua, he like give um chance, an dass why he wen pick um. No was cuz dey wen go do someting good, an dass why he gotta pick um, you know. If he gotta pick um cuz a da good tings dey wen do, den he no give um chance fo real kine, an he gotta pick um, az why. So wat, den? Da Israel peopo wen like get um right wit God, but dey no can do dat. Ony da peopo God wen pick wen get um right wit him. Da oddas, dey ony Fo Da Rome Peopo 11:17 da root from one tree to God, da whole tree stay spesho fo him too. Jalike da Jewish peopo was one olive tree, an God wen hemo some branches from dat tree, an den he wen plant odda branches on top dat tree. You guys dat not Jews, you jalike one nodda kine olive tree dat grow wild outside one olive tree farm, but God plant you on top one good tree inside da farm. Jalike da odda branches, you get da same kine good tings from God, jalike da Jewish peopo. You know, you betta not get big head an tink dat you mo betta den da odda branches dat God wen hemo! If you get big head, rememba dis - - you not da one dat make da tree strong, cuz you ony one branch. Dass da root dat make you strong! Den might be you goin say, “Eh, God wen go hemo one branch so I can go stay same place wea dat branch was.” 20 Yeah but, God wen hemo dose branches cuz dey no trus God, az why. An you, you stay dea cuz you trus God. Eh, no get big head! Mo betta you be scared! Da Jewish peopo, dey jalike da branches dat wen grow dea first -- but God neva let um stay dea. An you? You tink he goin let you stay ova dea if you no stay trus him? Not even! So, tink bout dis: God get good heart -- chance! No matta, God still yet get love an but same time, he can punish hard. He goin punish hard da guys dat no get um strait wit him. But wit you guys dat not Jews, God get good heart fo you guys if you stick wit God an let him be good to you. But if you no let him get good heart fo you, he goin hemo you from da tree too. Same ting wit da Jewish peopo, if dey change dea heart, an start fo trus God, God goin plant dem togedda on top da main olive tree one mo time. God can go plant um back, jalike dey was befo time. You know, you peopo dat not Jewish, you jalike one branch dat wen get hemo from one olive tree dat wen grow wild outside da farm. God wen plant you inside da good olive tree, no matta dass not da tree wea you wen grow first time. Mo betta still yet, da Jewish peopo, God goin plant um back, inside da same tree wea dey wen grow first time.

Dat gate, dey wen name um “Beautiful.” Dey put 149 Jesus Guys 3:26 he da One dat wen make him come good all da way. An you guys can see dat he stay good. “My bruddas, I know dat wat you guys an yoa leadas wen do to Jesus, you neva undastan wat you doing. Da guys dat wen talk fo God long time ago wen tell inside da Bible dat da Spesho Guy God Goin Send gotta suffa. An dass how dat wen come true. “So den, you guys gotta come sorry an stop doing all da bad kine stuff you do, an stick wit God, an den he goin take away yoa shame fo all da bad kine stuff you guys wen do. An da Boss goin make you guys rest inside an make you guys strong inside yoa hearts. He goin send his Spesho Guy Jesus, da One he wen pick fo help you guys. Jesus gotta stay inside da sky till da time come wen God goin make everyting new. Jalike da spesho guys dat wen talk fo God long time ago wen tell, dat God wen promise fo do dat. Moses wen Peter Teach Inside Da Temple Yard tell, you know, ‘God yoa Boss, he goin give (Da Start 22:18; 26:4; Outa Egypt 3:6,15; Da you guys one Guy goin be jalike me, dat Jewish peopo. You guys gotta listen an do everyting he tell you.’ 23 Moses wen say dis too: ‘Anybody dat no like listen to dat Guy dat talk fo God, God goin wipe dem out from dea peopo.’ ” 24 Den Peter say, “Befo time, Samuel an all da odda guys dat wen talk fo God afta him, dey all wen tell bout wat stay happen now. You guys da one wen get wat dey wen talk bout. Dass fo you guys, da deal God wen make wit yoa ancesta guys long time ago. God wen tell Abraham, ‘All da diffren peopos all ova da world, bumbye wen dey tink bout da peopos dat come from you, dey goin say, “We like God make everyting come good fo us guys, cuz we stay tight wit da Abraham ohana!” ’ 26 God wen pick his Spesho Helpa Jesus, an send him by you guys first. He send him so he can do good kine stuff fo you guys, an make you guys so you no do da bad kine stuff no moa.” 4 Peter An John Go In Front Da Main Leadas (Songs fo God 118:22) 150 Jesus Guys 4:26 dis guys, dey wen stay wit Jesus. But da leadas can see da guy dat Peter dem wen make come good, stay standing dea wit dem, so dey no can say notting. So da leada guys tell Peter an John fo go outside, an da leada guys wen talk togedda. Dey say, “Wat we goin do wit dem? Everybody dat stay inside Jerusalem know dat dey wen do one awesome ting dat show wat kine dem. An us guys no can say dass not true. We gotta tell dese guys, ‘You guys betta not talk bout dis guy Jesus to nobody no moa! No use his name fo do stuff!’ No good all da odda peopo all ova da place hear bout dis ting!” 18 Den da leada guys wen tell Peter an John fo come inside one mo time.

So he wen yell inside dea, “My brud- das, I one Pharisee guy, an one Pharisee guyʼs boy. Dey stay bring me in front da main leadas cuz I stay waiting an I believe dat we goin come back alive from mahke.” 177 Jesus Guys 23:35 goin ack jalike dey like find out mo stuff bout him.

I wen find out dat he neva do notting wrong. Dey say he wen do stuff agains dea rules, but I neva find notting fo say he gotta mahke o go jail. Wen I know dat dey wen make plan fo kill him, right den an dea I wen send him by you. An I tell da guys dat poin finga at um fo come tell you bout um.” 31 Da army guys wen do wat he wen say. Dey wen take Paul wit dem dat nite, an wen bring him Antipatris side. Da nex day dey wen let da guys on horses take him da rest a da way, an dey wen go back dea place. Wen da guys on horses wen come to Cesarea, dey wen give da letta to da governa, an give Paul to da governa too. Da governa wen read da letta, an wen aks him wea he come from.

So, I everytime try fo do all Da Jewish Guys Poin Finga At Paul da right stuff an make my heart stay good 17 “Long time I stay odda places, an den 22 Felix da Governa, he wen know plenny stuff.” 23 He tell da captain fo watch Paul, an no tie him up, an let his friends come Paul Talk In Front Felix Paul In Front Felix an Drusilla 24 Afta litto wile Governa Felix wen come 27 Two years lata, Porcius Festus wen 179 Jesus Guys 26:1 25 tell um dat da Rome peopo no hand ova Paul Like Talk To Cesar, Da Big King anybody befo he stand in front da judge, Festus wen come Cesarea side an den dey can poin finga at him an he can talk fo himself. Wen dey come ova hea by me, right den an dea I neva wait, but I wen sit on top da judge chair da nex day. An I wen tell um fo bring da prisona in front me. Wen da guys dat poin finga at him wen stand up fo talk, dey neva say notting believe one way an Paul believe one nodda way, an dey wen make argue bout dat, an bout one mahke guy name Jesus, dat Paul say he still stay alive. I neva know how fo check out all dat stuff, dass why I wen aks him if he like go Jerusalem an stand in front da judge ova dea. But Paul say he like go in front da Big King Cesar. So, I wen come.” 22 King Agrippa wen tell Governa Festus, “I like listen to dis guy.” Festus say, “Tomorrow you goin hear him.” 23 Da nex day King Agrippa an Queen Bernice wen come all dress up an make big show. Dey wen go inside one big place wit all da main captains an da main leada guys fo da town. Festus tell da guys fo bring Paul inside, an dey wen bring him. Festus say, “King Agrippa, an all you guys dat stay hea wit us, hea da guy! All da Jewish peopo wen tell me bout him inside Jerusalem an ova hea inside Cesarea. Dey wen yell dat he notting he wen do dat he gotta mahke. But he wen aks fo go in front King Cesar, so I say he can go ova dea Rome side. But I one letta fo send da Boss Cesar. Dass why I wen bring him in front all you guys, an even mo in front you, King Agrippa, so you Paul In Front King Agrippa An Queen Ber- can check him out, an den I can write down someting. Cuz I tink no stay good fo send one prisona ova dea if I no can say how come dey poin finga at um.” 26 Paul Talk Fo Himself In Front King Agrippa 1 King Agrippa tell Paul, “You can talk fo 180 Jesus Guys 26:29 come fo pick you fo work fo me an fo tell odda peopo wat you wen see an wat I goin show you.

Den I goin let um go, an hemo dea shame fo all da bad kine stuff dey do, an dey can come togedda wit all da peopo dat trus me an come spesho an good fo me.’ Paul Tell Bout His Work 19 So den, King Agrippa, I wen do wat God wen show me.

Wen we was ready fo sail, dey wen give us all da stuffs we wen need. From Malta To Rome 11 Aftathree months we wen sail on top one boat dat wen stay by Malta Island all winta. Da boat wen come from Alexandria an had da twin gods Castor an Pollux on da front. We wen come to Syracuse an stay ova dea three days. We wen sail from dea an wen come Regium. Da nex day da sout wind wen come, an da nex day we wen come Puteoli. Ova dea we wen meet some bruddas. Dey wen tell us fo come stay dea house fo one week. An den we wen go way from dea fo go Rome. Da bruddas ova dea wen hear dat we stay coming, an 183 Jesus Guys 28:31 But you no goin see fo real. Cuz dis peopo hard head, Dea ears no can hear good. Dey close dea eyes, Inside Rome Cuz dey no like see fo real. (Isaiah 6:9-10) Dea ears no like hear fo real. Inside dey no like undastan fo real. Dey no like change so I can make um come good.” ’ Dass wat Isaiah wen say.” 28 Paul say, “I like you guys know dat God send his guys by da peopo dat not Jews, so he can take dem outa da bad kine stuff dey do. An dey goin listen!” 29 [So da Jewish guys wen go way an wen make argue real hard wit each odda.] 30 Fo two years Paul wen stay ova dea inside one house he wen rent. He wen show aloha fo all da peopo dat wen come by him. He wen teach um how dey can get God fo dea King an all bout da Boss Jesus, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. He not scared shut up. But you no goin undastan. Fo Da Rome Peopo 1:18 know dat I not goin give up tinking bout you guys. Everytime I go pray, I aks God Da Letta From Paul lidis: “You know, if you like, I donno how Fo Da Rome Peopo you goin do dis, but been really long time I like go see dem guys Rome side.” 11 I really like stay by you guys, cuz I like “Aloha!” share da good kine stuff from Godʼs Spirit wit you guys. Den you can stay mo strong an mo solid inside. Dis, az wat I mean: Bumbye wen I go stay wit you guys, I like you guys give me good kine words cuz you guys trus God, an same ting, I goin give you 2 Befo time, God wen make his talka guys guys good kine words cuz I trus him too jalike you guys. Bruddas an sistas! I like you guys know dis: Plenny times I tink, “Maybe az now da time fo me fo go by da Rome peopo!” But den, dat time, no can. Ony now, I can go. Wen I go ova dea fo stay wit you guys, I like plenny peopo go trus Christ, an everyting come mo betta fo you guys, jalike wen happen wen I wen stay wit da odda peopos. No matta get guys Greek o no Greek, o guys who get smarts o guys dat no moa, I 5 Dass how Jesus stay, an dass why God jus gotta take care all dem awready. Dass why I stay ready fo tell you guys all da Good Kine Stuff From God wen I go ova dea Rome side fo see you guys. Da Good Kine Stuff From God, Get Plenny Power 6 Same ting fo you Rome guys too. You (Habakkuk 2:4) 16 I no shame notting bout da Good Kine from God, fo take peopo outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing, wen dey trus him. Was da Jewish peopo dat wen find out bout um first, an afta dem, all da odda peopos from diffren places too. You tink bout all dis Good Kine Stuff From God, you goin undastan wat God wen do fo make peopo come right wit him. But gotta trus him How Paul Pray Fo His Friends from da start to da end. Da Bible wen say “Gotta trus God. Den you goin get um right wit him, Everybody Make How Dey Not Suppose To 185 Fo Da Rome Peopo 2:3 do. An so dey all come all itchy, an no mo shame notting. Eh, you know, even da wahines, dey no like make like dey wahines, dey like change how dey stay. An same ting wit da guys. Dey no like make like dey suppose to wit da wahines. One guy stay all itchy fo one nodda guy. Dey no mo shame notting fo how dey make wit each odda. So fo dat, dey goin get it! Cuz dey stay far from da right way, an dey going get watevas fo how dey wen make. Dey tink, “Mo betta no go tink bout stick tight wit God fo real kine!” Az why God wen let um go do how dey like do. Az why dey ony can tink pilau kine stuff. So, no good how dey make. Dey not right kine peopo. Dey ony do pilau kine stuff. Dey greedy guys. Dey get pilau attitude. Dey all jealous. Dey like kill peopo. Dey like go beef everybody. Dey sneaky buggas. Dey ony tink bad kine stuff. Dey tell stuffs dey not suppose to bout da odda guys. Dey talk stink. Dey so high makamaka, so dat peopo no can come by dem. Dey tink dey it. Dey talk big. Dey try figga how dey can make everyting hamajang. Dey no do wat dea mudda-fadda guys tell um fo do. Dey no like undastan notting. Dey make promise, but dey no keep um. Dey no mo love an aloha, an dey no give chance notting. God wen tell um how dey suppose to make, an dey wen hear all dat awready. Dey know dis too: if get anybody dat no make like wat God say, fo shua he goin mahke. But dese guys, dey go do all dat kine stuff, an dey tink good wen da odda guys go do lidat too. God Da Judge Goin Tell Um Strait 1 So den, no matta who you, if you go poin finga somebody dat he doing bad kine stuffs, no foget you doing da same kine tings jalike him. Eh, you too no mo excuse, cuz you poin finga back yoa own self. But we know dis: Everytime God tell dat da peopo wen do bad kine stuff, we know wat he say stay true. So, wat you figga? Wen you poin finga da odda guys cuz dey doing bad kine stuffs, 186 Fo Da Rome Peopo 2:29 doing. Wen dey go tink wat stay right an wat stay wrong, den dey figga. Dass how goin be bumbye wen God goin make Jesus Christ da Judge fo da secret stuff inside everybodyʼs heart. Dass wat da Good Kine Stuff From God say, jalike I stay teaching. Da Jewish Peopo An Godʼs Rules 17 Now you dea, you like peopo fo know you one Jewish guy. You trus Godʼs Rules. You talk big bout God. You know wat God like you fo do. You know wass da bestes kine stuff, cuz da teachas wen teach you from Godʼs Rules. You stay shua you can tell da peopo dat no can see wea fo go. You tink you jalike one light fo all da peopo dat stay inside da dark. You can teach da peopo who donno notting an da ones dat Rules, you tink you get all da trut an you know everyting. So, you go teach da odda peopo. You teach yoaself too, o wat? You go preach dey betta not rip off nobody. You rip off too, o wat? You say, “No go fool aroun behind yoa husban o wifeʼs back.” You go fool aroun too, o wat? You tink da idol kine gods no good. You take stuff from dea temples, o wat? You talk big bout Godʼs Rules. You making God shame cuz you broke um, o wat? Jalike da Bible wen say befo time, “Da peopos dat not Jews try run down Godʼs name cuz a you guys.” 25 If you do wat Godʼs Rules say, az good you get da cut skin mark dat show you one Jewish guy. But if you go broke Godʼs Rules, az jalike you no mo da mark awready, an you not one Jewish guy fo real kine. So den, if get one guy dat not one Jew, an he do all da good kine stuff Godʼs Rules say, den no matta he neva cut skin, he Godʼs guy. Dass jalike he get da mark too. So den, da peopo dat not Jews, if dey do wat Godʼs Rules say, dey goin show dat you Jewish peopo wen broke Godʼs Rules. No matta dey no mo da cut skin mark, an you guys get da Rules inside da Bible from befo time, an da cut skin mark too. No matta somebody who come from Abraham get da cut skin mark on top his body, dat no make him one Jewish guy fo real kine. Da Jewish guy who fo real stay same ting lidat inside. Godʼs Spirit stay in 187 Fo Da Rome Peopo 3:22 9 So den, wat? You tink us Jewish peopo stay mo betta den dem? No way! Cuz I wen awready show you guys dat da bad kine stuff get power ova everybody, da Jewish peopo an da peopo dat not Jews. Jalike da Bible wen say, 3 “No mo nobody dat do da right ting every- Mo Stuff Bout Da Jewish Peopo An Godʼs time. No mo even one guy! No mo nobody dat undastan, No mo nobody dat try fo know God! Nobody eva do how dey suppose to. All togedda dey wen come poho. No mo nobody dat do good tings, No mo even one guy! Dea mout stay jalike one open grave. Dey bulai wit dea mout. Da poison come from inside dea mout, Jalike one snake. Wit dea mout Dey everytime like say stink stuffs fo hurt somebody, Dat wat he say, az right. Cuz az how dey stay inside. Dey move fast fo kill somebody. Every place dey go, He goin win still yet, Cuz he no do da bad kine stuff not- Dey like bus up everyting, ting.” An make big trouble fo peopo. Dey neva know how fo make good wit odda peopo, An make dea hearts rest inside. Dey no mo respeck fo God notting.” 19 Now, we know dat everyting Godʼs Rules say, dass fo da peopo dat get da Rules ova dem. Dass why nobody can make argue wit God. Bumbye everybody all ova da world gotta go in front God da Judge, so he can say if dey wen do da bad kine stuff, o wat. Dass why no mo nobody dat can say dat dey get um right wit God, jus cuz dey wen do everyting Godʼs Rules say. Not even! Godʼs Rules ony show dat us wen do da bad kine stuff. God Make Us Get Um Right Wit Him Wen We Trus Um 21 Stay clear now how God wen go make plan so we can get um right wit him. We can get um right wit him, but not cuz a No Mo Nobody Dat Do Da Right Ting Every- Godʼs Rules. Godʼs Rules an da guys dat wen talk fo God long time ago, dey tell all dat (Songs fo God 5:9; 14:1-3; 36:1; 53:1-3; 140:3; inside da Bible. God wen make us get da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. He do dat 188 Fo Da Rome Peopo 4:12 2 We can say dis:If Abraham wen get um right wit God cuz a da stuffs he wen do, den he no can talk big notting. Dis wat da Bible say: Dass why God wen say dat Abraham get um right wit him.” 4 Cuz wen get one guy dat work, his boss pay him fo dat. Da pay not one present -- get da right fo say dat whoeva trus him, dey work fo get um right wit God, ony gotta 6 Same ting. David wen talk bout how work notting fo dat. He say: God wen let um go, Az why dey stay good inside! God wen hemo dem from all da bad kine stuffs dey wen do. Da guy can stay good inside Wen da Boss no make one list A da bad kine stuff da guy wen do.” 9 You tink ony da Jewish guys dat get da good inside lidat, an da odda guys, dey no can? You know, awready we wen tell dat wen tell dat Abraham get um right wit him. Kay den, wat time was, wen God wen say mark, o befo wen he neva get da mark? Eh, wen he neva have um yet. Bumbye Abraham wen get da cut skin mark. Dat wen show proof dat he wen go trus God. Was befo Abraham get da mark dat God wen say Abraham get um right wit him. Dass how Abraham wen come jalike 4 da fadda fo everybody dat trus God, an God wen say dey get um right wit him, no matta Abraham dey no mo da mark. Same time Abraham da mark, but cuz dey stay trus Christ jalike 189 Fo Da Rome Peopo 5:11 right wit him too, if we trus him. Cuz God da One dat wen make Jesus our Boss come We Trus God, An We Get Wat He Promise back alive afta he wen mahke. Jesus wen mahke cuz we neva make how we suppose 5 We Get Um Right Wit God 1 So den, cuz we wen trus God, az why we get um right wit him. Dass why our how we come solid inside. We feel good 3 No matta we get any kine hard time, 6 Wen we neva have power notting, Christ wen mahke fo all us guys dat wen 9 God wen say we get um right wit him, 10 Befo time, we wen stay agains God. But same side wit God, even mo, Christ goin 190 Fo Da Rome Peopo 6:5 make us come alive fo real kine, an be da Kingʼs helpas. So, had dat one guy dat wen do wat he not suppose to do, an cuz a dat now everybody gotta get punish. But den same ting, had one nodda guy dat wen do da Adam an Christ, Dey Da Same But Dey right ting, an cuz a dat, everybody can get um right wit God an come alive fo real kine. Dis wat I mean: Adam, he one guy dat neva listen to God. Dat make plenny guys be peopo dat do da bad kine stuff dat God no like. An da odda guy Jesus, he wen listen to wat God wen tell him fo do. Dat goin make plenny guys be peopo dat get um right wit God. God wen give us his Rules so every- body goin know how plenny bad da bad kine stuff stay. But wea eva get peopo dat do da bad kine stuff mo an moa, God do mo an mo plenny good kine stuff. Befo time, da bad kine stuff dat peopo wen do, take ova dem an make um mahke. But now, cuz a wat our Boss Jesus Christ wen do, God do someting real good fo us, he take us ova, so us guys can get um right wit him an come alive fo real kine foeva. We No Mo Notting Fo Do Wit Da Bad Kine Stuff, But We Stay Live Fo God 1 So den, wat? You tink we goin say, “Mo bad kine stuffs we do, dat goin make God do some mo plenny good kine stuffs fo us bumbye.” We goin say all dat? Eh, no way! Us guys no mo notting fo do wit da bad kine stuff! Az jalike we mahke awready. Cuz you know, one mahke guy no can do notting bad. If we stay jalike we mahke, how we goin stay doing da bad kine stuff? Dass no good! You guys donno dat wen all us guys wen get baptize fo show we Jesus Christ guys, dass jalike we wen mahke same time he wen mahke? Wen we get baptize, dat mean jalike dey wen bury us same time dey wen bury Christ, cuz jalike we mahke too. Da Fadda, he get awesome power, an afta Christ wen mahke, da Fadda wen make um come back alive. So da Fadda like us use his power too fo live one new kine life. Us guys jalike we wen mahke wen Jesus wen mahke. Dass why fo shua we goin 191 Fo Da Rome Peopo 7:1 cut yoaself off from God. O you can be jalike one slave guy fo do wateva God tell you. An wen you pick dat one, you get um right wit him awready! I tell God “Mahalo plenny!” Cuz befo time, you guys wen let da bad kine stuff own you. But now, you guys listen from deep inside yoaself, fo do all da kine stuff da peopo dat stay spesho fo God wen teach you guys. God wen let you guys go, so you no gotta do da kine bad stuff no moa. Now you guys goin work hard fo do da right kine stuff. Fo tell you guys all dis, I stay talking da way everybody stay talk to each odda, cuz you guys ony litto bit strong inside. Befo time, was jalike you guys wen make yoaself be da kine peopo dat gotta do ony Rules from God. Az why you guys was lidat. But now, you guys gotta make yoaself be da kine peopo dat gotta do ony wass right. Dat goin make you guys be good an spesho fo God. Befo time, wen you guys was da kine peopo dat gotta do ony bad kine stuff, az wen you guys neva make yoaself be da kine peopo dat do da right ting. Wat good kine you wen do? Notting! Now you guys get plenny shame weneva you guys tink bout um. Cuz wen you do dat kine stuff, you ony cut yoaself off from God. But now, you guys no gotta do ony bad kine stuff no moa, cuz God wen let you guys go. Now, you guys da kine peopo dat work fo God! Dat goin make you guys be good an spesho fo God. An afta, garans you guys goin get da real kine life dat stay to da max We Jalike Slaves Fo Do Wass Right foeva. Dis da deal: wen you do da tings off from God. But get one nodda deal dat God get fo you. He like give you someting dass plenny good -- da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. An you get dis wen you stay tight wit Jesus Christ, our Boss. Afta You Mahke, Da Rules No Mo Power 1 Eh, all you bruddas an sistas dat undas- 192 Fo Da Rome Peopo 7:23 9 Da way I wen stay live befo time, I neva know da Rules. Den bumbye, I wen find out dat God wen say dat get tings I not suppose to go do -- an right den an dea, jalike all da bad kine stuff inside me wen wake up an make me go do dose tings! Den, az jalike I wen mahke inside. Had da Rules so dat peopo can come alive fo real kine. But den fo me, jalike was da Rules dat wen cut me off from get um right wit God. Da Rules wen tell how I gotta make awready. But had inside me bad kine stuff dat wen use da Rules dat God say fo bulai me. Cuz a dat, jalike was da Rules dat wen cut me off from get um right wit God. But den same time, da Rules stay spesho fo God, an everyting da Rules say we gotta do, all dat stay spesho fo God, stay right, an good. Da Rules stay some good. But you tink was da Rules wen cut me off from get um right wit God? Not even! Was da bad kine stuff inside me dat wen go use da Rules fo cut me off from God. Da Rules stay good, but dey show dat da bad kine stuff stay bad fo real kine, an dey cut us off from get um right wit God. So wen God say how us guys gotta make, dat show dat da bad kine stuff inside us no good! Da War Inside Us 14 We know dat da Rules come from Godʼs Spesho Spirit. But me, I ony one guy. I make jalike I one slave dat gotta do ony bad kine stuff. I donno wat I stay doing. Cuz, eh, I no do da tings I like do. I do da tings dat I no like. If I do da tings I no like do, dass not me dat do um, but da bad kine stuff dat stay inside me stay do um. I know dat no mo notting good inside Da Bad Kine Stuff Dat Stay Inside Us Da Rules no me. Everytime inside me I like do da bad kine stuff. I like do da good kine stuff, but den, I donno how fo do um! Da good kine stuff dat I like do, I no do um. But da bad kine stuff I no like do, I do um. Now, wen I do wat I no like, az not me dat make me do um, but da bad kine stuff dat stay inside me. Dat show, jalike wen get one rule dat say, wen I like do da good kine stuff, get da bad kine stuff inside me dat no like me do um. I stay real good inside wen I tink bout da Rules from God. But jalike 193 Fo Da Rome Peopo 8:15 Spirit like, dey ony tinking bout da kine stuff dat Godʼs Spirit like. Da guy dat ony like tink bout doing da bad kine stuff he like do, jalike he stay mahke inside awready. But da guy dat ony like tink bout doing wat Godʼs Spirit like, he stay alive fo real kine, an his heart stay rest inside. An if you ony like tink bout doing da kine stuff you do wen you live da way you like, cuz dass how you stay inside, you ony going agains God everytime, you know. Dat mean, you not doing wat Godʼs Rules say - - cuz you no mo da power fo do um. Da peopo dat ony stay doing da bad kine stuff dey like do, no way God goin like wat dey doing. But you guys, you guys da one dat no 8 stay doing da bad kine stuff you do wen you live da way you like. If Godʼs Spirit You Can Live Fo Real Kine If You Stay Tight stay live inside you, you guys stay doing da kine stuff Godʼs Spirit like. Whoeva no mo Christʼs Spirit inside him, dass da guy dat not Godʼs guy. But Christ stay tight wit kine, cuz you guys get um right wit God. So, no matta you guys goin mahke cuz you guys wen do bad kine stuff. God da One dat wen make Jesus come back alive afta he wen mahke. If Godʼs Spirit stay tight wit you guys, den he goin make you guys come back alive, yoa body, everyting, jalike how he wen make Christ come back alive. His Spirit goin do dat fo you guys, no matta yoa body gotta mahke. Godʼs Spirit Tell Us We Godʼs Kids 12 So den, bruddas an sistas, we gotta do someting. But we no need do notting fo da bad kine stuff inside us, da way our bodies like make us do. If you guys go ack jus da way you stay inside, fo shua kine you goin cut yoaself off from God! But den, if you let Godʼs Spirit help you kill off all da bad kine stuff you do wen you live da way you like, den you goin live fo real kine. Da peopo dat listen to Godʼs Spirit so he can tell um wat fo do, dem guys Godʼs kids. Wen you guys get Godʼs Spirit in charge a you, Godʼs Spirit no goin make you guys ack jalike slaves dat gotta stay scared all da time. Az how was befo time. Wen you get Godʼs Spirit in charge a you, you 194 Fo Da Rome Peopo 8:34 waiting fo someting we no can see still yet, den we still goin hang in dea an wait some moa. Same ting, Godʼs Spirit help us plenny, cuz we no mo power. We donno how fo pray da right way. But Godʼs Spirit, he go take ova an aks God fo do good tings fo us, no matta we jalike get big pain inside dat make us so we donno how fo say um. An God, he know all da tings dat us guys like say inside our heart, an he know how his Spirit tink. Dass how God know everyting his Spirit like say fo help us, cuz Godʼs Spirit tink jalike God tink, an da Spirit talk to God Bumbye God Goin Make Us Come Awesome an aks him fo help da peopo dat stay spesho fo God. Us guys know dis too: God make ev- eryting come out all good fo da peopo dat get love an aloha fo him. Befo time, God wen go make plan wat he goin do fo dem, an he wen tell um awready, “Come wit me! Be my guys!” 29 Befo time, he wen pick dose peopo awready, cuz he like make um come da kine peopo jalike his Boy. Godʼs Boy, dass Christ. He da main one, an da odda guys, dey jalike his younga bruddas an sistas. Dat same peopo God wen pick befo time lidat, he wen tell um fo come be his guys. An dose same guys, God wen make um get um right wit him, an he wen make um come awesome jalike him. God Get Love An Aloha Fo Us Guys 31 So den, wat we goin say bout all dat? God stay fo us guys to da max. Cuz God stay lidat, who going agains us? No mo nobody! God neva even hold back his own Boy. He wen make um one sacrifice fo help all us guys. God wen give his own Boy fo mahke fo us. You know, dat mean God no hold back notting. He give us every good ting 33 An den, who goin poin finga da peopo God wen pick? No mo nobody fo do dat! Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his peopo get um right wit him awready. Eh! No mo nobody dat can say God gotta punish all da peopo he wen pick. Jesus Christ, he da One dat wen go mahke. An mo importan den dat, he da One dat God wen make um come back alive afta he wen mahke. From dat time, he stay da mos importan place, by Godʼs right side. Same time, Jesus da One dat stay aksing God fo help us guys! Fo Da Rome Peopo 9:17 guys, da main fadda guys Abraham, Isaac, an Jacob (dass Israel, you know). An Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, he wen born from da same fadda guys too. Christ, he da One az God, an he da One dat stay in charge a everyting. He da kine Guy dat peopo like talk good bout him foeva! Dass right! Now, I not saying dat wat God wen say no goin happen. Cuz da peopo dat wen born from our ancesta guy Israel, inside, all dem guys not da fo real kine Israel peopo, you know. Same ting, get plenny peopo dat wen born from our ancesta guy Abraham, but not all dem Abrahamʼs kids fo real kine. Cuz God wen tell Abraham, “Da ony peopo dat I goin call yoa kids fo real kine, goin be da ones dat goin born from yoa boy Isaac.” 8 Dat mean, from befo time, from all da kids dat wen ony born from our ancesta guy Abraham till now, not all dem Godʼs kids, but ony da kids dat God wen promise fo born from Abraham, dey da ones dat God call his kids fo real kine. Dis wat God wen say wen he wen make da promise: “Same time nex year I goin come back, an Sarah goin born her baby boy.” 9 10 An dass not all, you know. Our ancesta God Wen Pick Da Israel Peopo guy Isaac an his wife Rebecca, dey wen get (Da Start 18:10,14; 21:12; 25:23; Malachi 1:2- twin boys. Dey both Isaacʼs kids.-12 But you know, befo Rebecca wen born her twin boys, an no matta her twin boys neva do notting good o bad yet, God wen tell Rebecca, “Da twin boy dat goin born first, he da one dat goin work fo da boy dat goin come out afta.” He wen tell her dat fo show dat wen God pick somebody, he pick um cuz he know wat he goin do wit dat guy. God jus wen tell um fo come be his guy. He no need wait till he find out how dat guy goin ack, cuz God know awready. Jalike God wen say inside da Bible, “I wen pick Jacob, but I neva take Esau.” 14 So den, wat we goin say? Dat God no treat everybody same same? Not even! Cuz God wen tell Moses, “I goin give chance to da ones I give chance to, An I goin show pity fo da ones I pity.” 16 Dass why, no matta wat one guy do, o wat he like happen, ony one ting matta -- dat God da One dat give um chance. Da Bible tell wat God wen say to da King 196 Fo Da Rome Peopo 9:32-33 Da same place wea God wen tell um befo time, ‘You guys, you not my peopo no moa!’ Dass da same place wea da God dat stay alive goin tell um bumbye, ‘You guys, you my kids now!’ ” Cuz he wen give um chance, az why. Befo time, Isaiah wen talk fo God in- God, He Give Chance, But Den, He No Take side da Bible. He say, “Get choke peopo dat get Israel fo dea (Da Start 19; Outa Egypt 9:16; 33:19; Isaiah ancesta. Da ohana big, jalike da sands on top da beach, Outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing. Cuz da Boss goin pau do everyting he wen say he goin do, 20 Eh, who you tink you? How All ova da world. Befo time, Isaiah wen say dis too: Wen let some a our kids stay alive. Jalike da peopo from Sodom town an Gomorrah town.” Da Israel Peopo An Da Good Kine Stuff From God (Isaiah 8:14; 28:16) 30 So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all kine peopos from diffren place dat not wit him, cuz dey stay trus um. But da Israel peopo was trying fo ony do wat Godʼs Rules say, fo get um right wit God, but dey no can do um.-33 How come dey neva get um right wit Jerusalem, I goin put one Guy. He goin be jalike one rock But still yet I goin call um ‘my peopo.’ Dat goin make peopo trip ova an fall down. But den, I goin call um ‘da nation I get But whoeva go trus dat Guy, love fo.’ ” Dey no need come shame.” An jalike da Israel peopo wen trip ova dat rock an fall down! Fo Da Rome Peopo 10:19 10 wit yoa heart dat you trus God, an den he make you get um right wit him. An az wit yoa mout dat you talk strait everybody dat Jesus stay yoa Boss, an den God goin hemo you from da bad kine stuff. Jalike da Bible say, “Whoeva trus God, no way dey goin come shame, cuz God goin do everyting wat he say.” 12 Da Jewish peopo an all da odda peopos, dey all same same. No mo diffrence. Cuz get da one Boss, an he da Boss fo everybody. He goin do plenny fo everybody dat aks him fo kokua dem. Cuz da Bible say, “Everybody dat aks da Boss fo help um, he goin take um outa da bad kine stuff dey doing.” 14 But eh! How dey goin aks him fo help um if dey no trus him? An how dey goin trus him if dey neva hear notting bout him? An how dey goin hear bout him if nobody eva go tell um notting bout him? God Like Take Everybody Outa Da Bad Kine 15 An how dey goin tell peopo if nobody send um fo go teach? Jalike da Bible say, Da Prieses 18:5; Da Rules Second Time 30:11- “Wen peopo go fo tell da Good Stuff From God, eh! dass so awesome!” 16 But you know, wen get Israel peopo dat neva like listen to da Good Kine Stuff From God. Jalike Isaiah wen say inside da Bible: “Eh Boss! No mo nobody dat like go trus Da tings dat dey wen hear from us guys!” 17 So den: Fo trus God, gotta listen to da tings he say. An fo listen to wat God say, first gotta hear bout Christ. Try let me aks dis: You guys tink da Israel peopo neva hear notting, o wat? Fo shua dey wen hear! Jalike da Bible wen say befo time: “All ova da world, get peopo dat wen hear da Good Stuff. Da tings dey say, wen go all ova da place wea get peopo.” 19 An I aks one nodda ting: “Da Israel peopo, you tink dey neva undastan not- ting?” Moses da first one dat wen go tell inside da Bible, dat God wen say dis: “I goin do someting fo some odda peopos Dat not jalike you guys, An dat goin make you guys jealous. An I goin do someting fo peopo dat you guys tink stupid, An dat goin make you guys come huhu.” 198 Fo Da Rome Peopo 11:16 wen come mo hard head still yet an dey no listen to God. Dis wat da Bible wen say befo time: Dey da ones dat wen find me. “God wen make um come Jalike dey no can tink o feel notting. Dea eyes no can see notting, To da peopo dat neva aks fo see me.” Dea ears no can hear notting, Right up till now.” 9 David wen say dis inside da Bible: Waiting fo da Israel peopo fo come by “No matta dey party up at dea own table -- me, I like God make dat party jalike one trap Dey ony like go do someting else.” Fo catch um an pay um back! I like God make dea eyes close so dey no 11 can see notting! God Give Chance To Da Israel Peopo I like he bend um down to size!” God Goin Make Da Peopo Dat Not Jews Come Okay 11 So den, I like aks dis: How come da Jewish peopo wen go mess up? Was fo make um wipe out, o wat? No way! But afta dey wen go do da way dey not suppose to an no trus God, dat wen mean, now all da odda peopo dat not Jews can get outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in. An dat make da Israel peopo come jealous. Fo shua, da Israel peopo wen make like dey not suppose to. An cuz dey wen do dat, dat wen mean, da odda peopo all ova da world you, get all kine good tings from God. Da Israel Dese da peopo dey wen kill! peopo, dey wen lose everyting, an cuz a dat, all da peopo dat not Jews wen come Dey wen go bus um up. jalike dey rich! Kay den -- bumbye, all da Jewish peopo goin come strait wit God, an Dat stay alive still yet. den, everyting goin come mo betta still yet! Now fo you guys dat not Jews, I like too!” say dis one ting: God wen send me all ova da place by da odda peopos dat not Jews, real importan! You know, might be, if I do good job, I can go make my own kine peopo come jealous, an den, dass how I can help some a dem come outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in. Wen God neva take his own peopo befo, dat wen mean dat da odda peopos all ova da world wen get chance fo go da same side wit God. Bumbye, wen God take back his own peopo, goin be jalike dey was mahke befo, but now dey wen come alive fo real kine! Eh, you know, if you take litto bit bread, an give um to God, den da whole bread stay spesho fo him too. If you give 199 Fo Da Rome Peopo 11:33 25 Bruddas, dis someting you guys gotta know, dat was secret befo time. If you undastan um, den you no going get big head cuz you tink you smart. Dis da ting dat was secret: Da Israel peopo, dey wen come hard head an neva like trus God now, but den, dey no goin stay lidat foeva. Bumbye wen all da peopo dat not Jews goin trus God, den da Jewish peopo, dey goin go trus um too. Dass how dat time, all da Israel peopo, God goin take um outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in, jalike God wen say inside da Bible befo time: “Goin get one guy dat goin take us outa da bad kine stuff, He goin come from Jerusalem, Zion side. He goin make da peopo dat come from Jacob tink diffren kine, Dem guys, dey ack jalike God no matta, Bumbye, dey no goin tink lidat no moa. An I goin hemo dea shame fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do. I goin make one spesho deal wit dem” 28 So, da way da Israel peopo ack weneva dey hear da Good Kine Stuff From God, jalike dey stay agains God everytime. An cuz dey making lidat, dat give you guys aloha fo dem, cuz he wen love dea ancesta guys an pick dem fo come his peopo. You know, wen God give you someting, he no take um back. Wen he tell you, “Eh! Come wit me! Be my guy!” -- he no goin change his mind. Befo time, you guys dat not Jewish neva like do wat God wen tell you fo do. But now, you guys get chance, cuz da Jewish peopo da ones dat no like do wat God tell um. Right now, da Jewish peopo no like do wat God tell um fo do. Cuz a dat, God stay give you guys chance. Same ting lidat, God goin give da Jewish peopo chance too. Right now, God make everybody same same, so dey no can do wat he tell um, jalike dey stuck. He do dat, fo give chance to everybody, same same. God, He So Good! Isaiah 40:13; Job 41:11 33 Ho, da smart God stay! God, he know how fo use all his smarts!

Ony get one ting dass good fo owe peopo -- dass love an aloha. Wen you go show 13 dem love an aloha, dat mean you listen to everyting da Rules say awready. Da Rules say, “No go fool aroun, no go kill nobody, wat you like,” an plenny odda kine stuffs too. Fo do all da tings da Rules say, ony gotta listen dis Rule: “Get love an aloha fo da odda guy jalike you get love an aloha fo yoaself.” 10 Eh, you show love an aloha fo da odda guy, you no goin do notting fo make bad kine to him! So den, wen you show um love an aloha everytime, dass how you goin do everyting da Rules from God tell you fo do. If you do da right tings how suppose Pretty Soon, Christ Goin Come Back God goin hemo us guys from da bad 11 kine stuff, an da time dat goin happen, dat time mo close now den befo, wen we wen go trus Jesus Christ. Dass why you guys gotta get love an aloha, cuz you know how everyting stay nowdays. Jalike us guys up awready! Litto mo pau da nite time, almos day time awready! So, good we pau how peopo do dark time, wen nobody no goin put on da kine stuff da army guys use 202 Fo Da Rome Peopo 14:16 guy dat no eat meat, he do um fo show “Mahalo plenny!” 7 Eh, you know, wit us guys, wen we stay alive, we no live jus our own self. Wen we mahke, same ting, we no mahke jus our own self too. Wen we live, we stay tight wit da Boss. Same ting, wen we mahke, we stay tight wit da Boss too. So no matta we stay alive o mahke, everytime he stay our Boss. Dass how come Christ wen go mahke, an den wen come back alive. He wen do dat so he can be da Boss fo da peopo peopo dat stay alive too. So, how come you try ack jalike one 14 judge an say yoa brudda o sista stay wrong? No Judge Yoa Brudda-Sista Guys How come you make um jalike dey stay no good? Eh, bumbye all us guys gotta go in front God da Judge, fo him fo judge us, you know. Da Bible wen say befo time, “Da Boss tell: ‘Fo shua I stay alive. An fo shua, Everybody goin go down on top dea knees in front me Fo show dey get respeck fo me. Dey goin tell wit dea mout Dat dey know I dea Boss, cuz I stay God.’ ” 12 So den, all us guys gotta tell God how come we wen do da tings dat we wen do. No Do Notting Dat Goin Make Yoa Bruddas An Sistas Mess Up 13 So pau awready poin finga da odda peopo. Mo betta figga lidis: no good we do tings dat goin make our bruddas an sistas mess up. No good we go try fo trap um so dey do da bad kine stuff. I know dis fo shua, cuz I stay tight wit da Boss Jesus: No mo notting dat make peopo so dey no can pray. But if one guy tink someting make him so he no can pray, den goin be kapu fo him. So if you go eat meat, an cuz a dat, you make yoa brudda o sista hurt plenny inside, eh, you no mo love an aloha fo dem, o wat? Eh! No go jam up da odda guy, jus fo eat wat you like. Cuz you know, Christ wen mahke fo dat guy too! No good if you go do someting dat you figga stay okay, but same time peopo talk stink bout wat you stay doing. Fo Da Rome Peopo 15:11 good inside. Jalike God wen say befo time inside da Bible bout da bad kine stuff goin happen to Jesus, “Wen dey stay talk any kine stuff to yoa face, Az jalike dey telling me same ting.” 4 Everyting dat peopo wen write inside da Bible befo time, all dat stay inside da Bible fo teach us, so den we can come mo strong fo hang in dea, an we can go get good kine words from da Bible.

Den peopo goin tell how awesome God stay. I like say dis: Christ wen come jalike one worka guy fo help da Jewish peopo fo know dat God tell da trut an he do wat he say, an fo make um come true all da tings God wen promise our ancesta guys fo happen. Den all da diffren odda peopos too, dey goin tell how awesome God stay, cuz dey know dat he get pity fo us guys an give us guys chance. Jalike David wen say befo time inside da Bible, 15 “Az why I goin talk good bout you plenny Do Wat Make Da Odda Peopo Stay Good To all da odda diffren peopos. I goin sing songs bout wat kine guy you in (Songs fo God 69:9) front oddas.” 10 But da same ting, get one nodda place inside da Bible dat tell, “Eh, all you diffren peopos from all ova da place, Stay good inside, jalike Godʼs own peopo.” 11 Anodda place inside da Bible David say dis: “All you odda diffren peopos, Go tell how awesome an good da Boss stay.” 204 Fo Da Rome Peopo 15:33 stay teaching awready.

From long time I like go, but den, I no can. But now, I pau do my work dis side, an long time now, I wen like plenny fo go see you guys. Az why, wen I go Spain side, I like stop see you guys dat time. Afta I stay wit you guys litto wile, you guys can kokua me fo go Spain. God Wen Send Paul All Ova Fo Talk Fo Him 25 I going Jerusalem side first, fo kokua (Isaiah 52:15) da peopo ova dea dat stay spesho fo God. Cuz da bruddas an sistas Macedonia side an Akaia side wen like give money fo kokua da poor peopo Jerusalem side dat stay spesho fo God. Dey wen figga fo do dat, an dass good, cuz dey owe da Jerusalem peopo. Cuz all da odda peopos from all ova wen get da same good kine stuff dat da Spirit from God wen give da Jews first, so az good, yeah? if da church peopos dat not Jews give da Jewish bruddas an sistas some money fo help um. So afta I pau dis job, an make shua dat da Jerusalem bruddas an sistas wen get da money, den I goin see you guys wen I going Spain.

Fo Da Rome Peopo 16:25 16 wit dem.

[I like our Boss Jesus God, He Awesome! God get da power fo make you guys 206 Fo Da Rome Peopo 16:27 Da Letta Numba One From Paul 1 Dis letta from Paul. God wen tell me fo be his guy, cuz he like send me all ova da place fo tell peopo bout Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy he wen send. An Brudda Sostenes, he helping me write dis. Dis letta fo you church peopo dat come togedda fo God inside Corint town. God wen make you guys spesho fo him cuz you stay tight wit Jesus Christ. He wen tell you Christ!” guys fo come be his spesho peopo. Dass jalike all da odda peopo all ova da world dat talk to da Boss Up Dea wen dey need help. Jesus Christ, he da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, an he da Boss fo dem guys an fo us guys. God, he our Fadda, an Jesus Christ, he our Boss. I like dem do plenny good kine stuffs fo you guys, an make yoa hearts rest inside. Everytime I tink bout you guys, I tell God “Mahalo plenny fo dem Corint peopo!” God get good heart, so he do plenny good stuffs fo you guys, cuz you guys stay tight wit his Spesho Guy Jesus Christ. An he make you guys rich inside wit all kine good tings, cuz you guys stay tight wit Christ. Cuz a dat, you guys know da importan kine stuff you guys need fo know, an da bestes way fo tell um. All da good kine stuff us guys wen tell you guys bout Christ, stay solid awready inside you guys. Dass how come you guys stay shua dat Christ stay fo real. So, you guys awready get all da good tings God give his peopo. You guys stay ready an waiting fo da time wen God goin show everybody our Boss Jesus Christ. Christ da One dat goin make you guys strong an solid all da way, till da time wen da stuff bout Christ an da cross get plenny our Boss, Jesus Christ, goin come back to dis world. Dat way you guys no goin jam up, an nobody can poin finga at you guys. God, he da One dat wen tell you guys fo come tight wit his Boy, our Boss Jesus Christ, an God everytime do wat he say. Eh, bruddas an sistas! I talking fo our Boss Jesus Christ wen I beg you guys fo tink da same way, an no split up. Gotta stick Fo Da Corint Peopo togedda, so you guys know how fo tink da same way, an can figga out tings da same way! “Aloha!” 11 Some peopo from Sista Cloeʼs house wen tell me dat some a you guys stay make argue wit each odda. Dis how I figga. Sound like you guys stay talking lidis: One guy say dis, “Me, I stick wit Paul!” One nodda guy say, “Me, I stick wit Apollos!” An anodda guy say, “Me, I stick wit Peter!” An dis odda guy go say, “Me, I stick wit 13 So, wat? No can split up Christ ohana, you know! Eh! You guys tink was me dat wen go mahke on top da cross fo you guys? No way! You guys tink wen dey baptize you, dat make you guys my guys, o wat? Not even! I tank God dat I neva baptize nobody ova dea by you guys. Ony da guys Crispus an Gaius. Dass why nobody ova dea can say dat dey wen get baptize fo come Paulʼs guys. -- Oh yeah, I rememba Mahalo Plenny! dis, I wen baptize some peopo in Stefanas house too. But I no can rememba if I wen baptize odda peopo ova dea by you guys. Eh, you know, wen Christ wen send me, no was ony fo baptize! Da main ting he wen send me fo, was fo tell all da Good Kine Stuff Bout Him! An he neva like me talk bout him jus fo sound smart. Cuz if I wen jus talk smart kine da way peopo tink, dat goin take away da power from wat wen happen wen Christ wen go mahke on top da cross. Christ Get Power From God (Isaiah 29:14) 18 All da stuff we telling bout how Christ wen mahke on top da cross, dat stuff sound stupid to da peopo dat stay going wipe out fo real kine. But fo us guys, he taking us outa all da bad kine stuff we stay in. So den, power from God fo help us guys. Dass jalike wat Isaiah wen write inside da Bible befo time: God say, “All dis stuff da smart guys know, I goin make um come jalike notting. Get Church Peopo Dat Like Split Up No matta how smart dey stay, 20 So wat den? Wat goin happen to da smart guys? An to da teacha guys dat teach da Rules? An to da guys dat nowdays can talk good an make you tink anodda way? Eh! God wen make all dem guys look stupid! He wen make all da smarts dat come from dis world come jalike notting! You know God, he so smart, he neva let da peopo inside dis world figga how dey can know him fo real kine. Cuz da kine smarts dey get inside dis world, not nuff. God, he figga lidis: mo betta send some guys aroun fo tell da peopo bout him, no matta get peopo dat tink da guys he send kinda crazy fo talk lidat. But God figga dat from da stuff his peopo tell, odda peopo can go trus him, an dass how he goin take um outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing. You know, da Jewish peopo, dey every- time like us guys fo do someting awesome fo show proof dat we get Godʼs power. An da Greek peopo, dey ony like hear da smart kine stuff dat dey tink az da trut. But us guys dat talk fo God, we stay tell peopo all ova da place how God wen send dis Spesho Guy Christ ova hea, an how odda guys wen hang um on top one cross an kill um. Da Jewish peopo, wen dey hear dat, dey no can handle, cuz dey tink Godʼs Spesho Guy no goin mahke eva. An da Greek peopo, wen dey hear um, dey tink, “Dass stupid!” 24 But get odda peopo, some a dem Jewish peopo an some a dem not Jewish, dey da ones God wen tell fo come be his peopo. Fo dem, Christ show um dat God get plenny power an he stay real smart. Cuz no matta da peopo tink God stupid, he still mo smart den dem. No matta dey tink God not strong, he still mo strong den dem. Eh, bruddas an sistas! Fo undastan wat I mean, tink bout wat wen happen wit you guys wen God wen tell all you guys fo come be his spesho peopo. If you tink da way da peopo inside da world tink, no mo plenny guys wit you guys dat get plenny smarts, o get da kine power fo make odda peopo do wat dey like. No mo plenny guys wit you guys dat come from one ohana wit big name. But God wen pick da peopo dat odda peopo from dis world tink lolo. Cuz I goin make everyting dey know jalike he goin make da smart peopo look shame, no good.” dass why. An da peopo dat look like dey not strong hea inside dis world, God wen pick dem, cuz he goin make da strong kine peopo look shame too. He wen pick da peopo dat no mo big name hea inside dis world, an da kine dey make fun of, an dose dat no mean notting to nobody. God goin use dem fo make da peopo who tink dey it, come jalike notting. So dat nobody can talk big wen dey stand in front God. You guys know how come you guys stay tight wit Jesus Christ? Cuz God like, dass why! God, he wen make Jesus da One dat can give us guys all his smarts. An Jesus make us guys get um right wit God, an come peopo dat stay spesho fo God, an he cut us guys loose from da power da bad kine stuff get ova us! So den, jalike da Bible wen say befo time: “Anybody like talk big, mo betta dey ony talk big bout da Boss, an not bout demself!” 2 Gotta Tell Everybody How Christ Wen Mahke On Top One Cross 1 Eh bruddas an sistas! Wen I wen go by you guys first time, I wen tell you guys all da kine stuff from God dat nobody eva wen know befo time. But I neva ack like I mo betta den you guys. An wen I wen talk to you guys, I neva talk jus fo make me look smart. Wen I was wit you guys, I wen figga lidis: I ony know one ting, an dass Jesus Christ. He da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, but was him da peopo wen hang on top one cross fo kill um. An dass da ony ting I know fo shua. You know, da first time, wen I wen go ova dea by you guys, I wen feel like I not strong, an I was scared an shaky. No matta I was teaching, o I was talking to plenny guys, same ting, aah? I neva like talk jus fo make da peopo tink, “Eh, we can trus wat dis guy telling us, cuz he know how fo talk real good, yeah?” No ways, brah! But wen I wen talk, I wen show you guys dat I get da Spirit in charge a me, az why I get power. Cuz I figga, no good you guys go trus God jus cuz you hear smart kine stuff dat peopo tell. Mo betta you trus God cuz he get da power, an you see wat he tight wit Godʼs Spirit. Dass why, if get can do. Fo shua, wen us guys talk to da peopo who stay solid inside, we teach um smart way da guy goin undastan. Gotta stay tight kine stuff. But we no teach da same kine wit Godʼs Spirit fo check out if dat kine stuff smart stuff da peopo inside da world stay az da trut. Da guy dat stay tight wit Godʼs teach nowdays, o da kine stuff da leada Spirit, he can check um out wateva. But guys tink too. (Dem leada guys, dey all same time, all da odda peopo, dey no can goin wipe out, you know.) 7 Us guys, we check out dat guy. Jalike da Bible wen teach ony da smart kine stuff dat come say: strait from God. Cuz God wen hide um from “Who can figga out wat God stay tinking, da peopo befo time, but from da start he wen figga he goin let us guys know um, so bumbye we goin come awesome. But da leada guys dat stay in charge nowdays, dey No mo nobody!” neva undastan. If dey wen undastan, fo But us guys, we know, cuz Christ help us shua dey no goin hang our awesome Boss guys tink jalike he tink. on top da cross fo kill um. So da smart kine stuff from God stay hide from befo time, jalike da Bible wen tell, “Get tings you neva see, Dass da kine stuff God wen make ready 10 But us guys, God show us all da stuff we meat. You guys suppose to be strong, jalike neva know befo time, cuz Godʼs Spirit stay you stay eat da meat awready! An still yet, in charge a us. Da Spirit, he undastan everyting. He guys stay tink jalike da peopo dat ony ack even check out how God stay, deep down how dey like, dass why. Wen somebody do inside him. Us guys, we all get our own someting mo betta den you, you get mad, spirit inside us. Dass how we know how an you like argue wit each odda an bus up we tink an ack. Same ting wit God -- no each odda!

Jalike I one good builda, God wen help me teach you guys solid stuff from da start, fo make shua you guys get one solid foundation fo yoa life. But da guy dat goin build on top dat foundation afta me, he gotta make shua he goin do um da right way. No can make any kine foundation, cuz ony get one foundation fo life -- dass Jesus Christ. God awready wen put him dea. Some peopo goin build on top dat foundation, wit good kine stuff, stuff jalike gold, o silva, o diamonds -- o dey goin build wit junk kine stuff, stuff jalike wood, o grass, o leaf. Bumbye, everybody goin know wat kine stuff dem peopo wen do, if was good o bad. Dat time, God goin make one test, jalike he use fire fo show if wat everybody wen do was jalike good kine stuff o junk kine stuff. If da stuff one guy tink bout da stuff I doing, o wat da odda wen do stay dea still yet afta da fire, God goin give dat guy plenny good kine stuff bumbye in da sky. But if da fire burn up wat da guy wen do, God no goin give dat guy notting. Still yet, da guy goin be okay, but ony jalike da house burn down an da guy almos neva get out. Eh! You know, you guys jalike one temple fo God, an his Spirit stay living inside you guys! If anybody mess up Godʼs temple wea he stay, watch out, brah! Bumbye God goin mess you up too! Cuz Godʼs temple stay spesho fo him. An you guys, jalike dat temple! No fool yoaself! If you tink you know an undastan everyting jalike all da peopo nowdays, dat mean, you donno notting. Wen you figga you donno notting, dass wen you goin start fo learn. Da way da peopo inside da world tink, God say dat stuff stay stupid. Da Bible say: “Da smart guys, dey sly buggas, But God take wat dey do an jam um up!” 20 One nodda place da Bible say: “Da Boss, he know how da smart guys stay tinking, Da guys dat suppose to know wat fo do. You Guys Jalike One Building He know dey ony tinking junk kine stuff dat wase time.” 21 So den, no good talk big bout some guy. Cuz everyting stay fo you guys awready. Me an Apollos an Peter, we stay fo you guys! An da whole world stay fo you guys, no matta you alive o mahke! Ev- eryting dat stay happening right now, an everyting dat goin happen lata -- everyting stay fo you guys! An you guys stay fo Christ, an Christ stay fo God! Da Guys Christ Send All Ova 1 So den, tink bout us guys lidis: We Christʼs helpas. God wen make us guys fo take care his stuff dat was secret befo time. Da guy dat goin take care his bossʼs stuffs, he gotta be da kine guy dat goin do wat he suppose to. No bodda me wat you guys peopo tink. I no even ack like one judge fo my own self. My heart tell me I okay, but dat no mean I okay. Da Boss, he da Judge fo wat I do. So, no make like you guys stay da judge fo odda peopo. Wait till da Boss come back. He da One goin bring out in da light, all da bad kine stuff da peopo try hide in da dark. He goin show all da tings dat dey tinking inside dea heart. Den God goin talk good bout da good tings everybody wen do. Bruddas an sistas, I wen talk bout me an Apollos, jalike I draw picha fo help you guys learn dis one ting from us guys: Ony do wat da Bible tell. If you guys learn dat, den you guys no goin talk big cuz you stay tight wit one a us guys an you make like da odda guy notting. So, wat? You guys tink you diffren from all da odda peopo? Everyting you guys get, God wen give um to you. So den, wen you guys get da stuffs, how come you guys ack all big head, jalike you guys wen get um by yoaself? So! You guys tink you get everyting you need awready! Jalike you guys rich, aah? You guys ack big, jalike kings, an us guys not! Fo shua, I like you guys come kings fo real kine, so us guys can come kings wit you guys too! Us guys dat God wen send all ova da place fo tell peopo bout Christ. I tink bout us guys lidis: God wen put us guys at da end a da line, jalike prisonas ready fo mahke. We jalike one show fo da peopo inside da world, an fo da angel messenja guys too. Peopo tink we stupid cuz we Christʼs guys, but dey tink you guys mo smart cuz you stay tight wit him! Us guys no stay strong, but you guys stay plenny strong! Peopo get respeck fo you guys, but dey no mo respeck fo us guys. Even now we stay hungry, but we still no mo food, an no mo notting fo drink. We ony get puka kine clotheses. Peopo beat us wit sticks. We no mo place fo stay. Eh, we work hard wit our hands. Wen dey talk any kine to us, we tell um, “We like God do good tings fo you guys.” Wen dey bus us up an make us suffa plenny, we still hang in dea. Wen dey talk Den you guys get da right fo ack fo da Boss. stink bout us, we talk good to dem. Dey tink us guys pilau. We jalike da rubbish from da world dat dey like throw way. Eh! I no write dis fo make you guys shame, but cuz I get love an aloha fo you guys jalike you my kids. Dass why I telling you guys dat you guys get problem. Get uku plenny guys dat teach you guys cuz you stay tight wit Christ. But you guys get ony one fadda, dass me! I stay tight wit Jesus Christ, dass why I wen tell you guys da Good Kine Stuff From God first time, an you guys wen go trus um. Az why I jalike you guys fadda. So I beg you guys fo make jalike me. So az why I stay send Timoty fo help you guys. I love him jalike he my own boy. He one guy I trus, cuz he stay tight wit da Boss too. He goin help you guys fo rememba da way I do everyting cuz I stay tight wit Jesus, Godʼs Spesho Guy. Dass jalike how I stay teach da peopo dat come togedda fo church all ova da place. But some a you guys ack big head, cuz you tink I no going ova dea by you guys. But if da Boss like, I goin come Corint side soon. Den I goin find out if dese guys dat ack big head ony mout, o if fo real dey get power! Cuz God stay King, an he not ony mout. He get da real kine power. So, wat you guys like? I come ova dea scold an punish you? O come ova dea, an give you guys love an aloha an no make presha? One Church Guy Go Fool Aroun (Da Rules Second Time 17:7; 19:19; 22:21,24; 24:7) 1 Fo real, some peopo telling dat one a you church guys stay fooling aroun ova dea. Da guy doing mo worse ting den da peopo dat donno God. He even stay sleeping wit his own step mudda! An you guys get big head! Mo betta you guys come sad an shame, an throw out da guy dat stay making lidat. No matta I no stay dea wit you guys, my heart stay dea. So, I awready wen judge da guy dat wen do dis bad ting. I get da right fo do dat cuz Jesus our Boss, an I his guy. So you guys, come togedda. An my heart goin be right dea wit you guys too. Den, hand dis guy ova to da Devil, so da bad kine stuff inside da guy goin get wipe out. Den wen Jesus, da Boss, come back, Jesus goin take da guy outa da bad kine stuff he stay in. No good you guys get big head! You guys donno dat ony litto bit yeast inside da bread dough can make da whole ting come big? Da yeast, dass jalike da bad kine stuff dat guy stay doing. An dat goin make da odda church peopo come bad too. Take out da guy from da church. Den you guys goin come jalike one new kine guy dat no mo notting bad inside. Dass how you guys stay. Dey wen kill Godʼs Spesho Guy, an dat make us guys clean inside, jalike wen dey wen kill one spesho baby sheep fo da Passova sacrifice. Us guys, we jalike da Bread Dat No Mo Yeast Inside, dat da Jewish peopo make fo eat Passova time. So us guys gotta watch out dat we no do da bad kine stuff, o hurt da odda peopo. We wen make lidat befo time. Mo betta tell da trut everytime, so everybody can see dat we do everyting wit good heart. Jalike I wen tell you guys inside my letta take anodda brudda in front da judge! Mo befo time, “No hang aroun da kine peopo dat go fool aroun.” 10 I no stay talking bout da peopo inside da world dat donno God, o da peopo dat like get everyting fo demself, o da peopo dat rip off da odda guy, o da peopo dat pray to da idol kine gods. Fo no stay aroun dat kine peopo, you gotta go one nodda planet! But now, I mean you guys betta not hang aroun one guy dat say he one brudda, but still yet he fool aroun, o he like get everyting ony fo himself, o he go pray to da idol kine gods, o he talk stink an bulai bout odda peopo, o he get drunk, o he rip off peopo. Dat kine guy, no do notting wit him -- no even eat wit um! Afta all, dass not my job fo make like da judge fo da peopo dat no trus God. But you guys suppose to be da judges fo da peopo inside da church, yeah? God goin be da Judge fo da peopo outside dat no trus him. But you guys, jalike da Bible say, “Da guy dat say he one a Godʼs guys, but still yet stay doing da real bad kine stuff, throw out da bugga!” Da Judge 1 Wot! If one a you guys get one beef agains anodda brudda, you guys no mo shame fo go stand in front one judge dat no get um right wit God? Mo betta you go in front da peopo dat stay spesho fo God, fo handle yoa beef! You guys ack like you donno dat bumbye, da peopo dat stay spesho fo God goin be da judge fo all da peopo inside da whole world. So how come you guys no can figga out dis small kine stuff by yoaself? You know, all us guys goin even be da judge fo da angel guys. So den, gotta be you guys can handle fo judge da small kine stuff inside dis world. Plus, if you guys get one beef agains one nodda brudda bout small kine stuff, den, how come you guys go pick peopo fo be da judge dat get no mo respeck from da odda church guys? An now, I like say someting dat goin make you guys shame: No even get one smart guy ova dea dat can figga out da small kine stuff dat da bruddas an sistas get wit each odda, o wat? But one brudda go worse, da judge no even trus God! Someting wrong, aah? Jam up, if you guys take each odda in front da judge. Mo betta, you let da odda guy go if he wen do wrong to you! If he steal from you, mo betta, jus let um take da stuff! But you guys, you do bad kine stuff to each odda, an steal from each odda too, an dey yoa Christian bruddas an sistas, an den! You guys ack jalike you donno dis: Da peopo dat no like do da right ting, no way dey goin get God fo dea King. No let nobody bulai you guys fo make you do wrong! Da guys dat fool aroun da wahines, da peopo dat go pray to da idol kine gods, da peopo dat sleep wit da odda guyʼs wife o husban, da guys dat go fool aroun da odda guys fo money, da mahu kine guys, 10 da steala guys, da greedy guys dat like hog everyting fo demself, da drunk guys, da peopo dat talk any kine to one nodda guyʼs face, da peopo dat con da odda guy -- fo all dese kine peopo, no way dey goin get God fo dea King! Dass how some a you guys wen do befo 6 time. But God, he wen make you guys clean One Brudda Take Anodda Brudda In Front from all da bad kine stuff you wen do. He wen make you guys come spesho fo him. He wen make you guys get um right wit him. All dat wen happen cuz you guys stay tight wit da Boss Jesus, Godʼs Spesho Guy, an wit our Godʼs Spirit too. If You Show Respeck Fo Yoa Body, Dat Show You Get Respeck Fo God (Da Start 2:24; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 10:23; 2 Corinthians 6:16) 12 Eh! Az okay fo me fo do all kine stuff. But, everyting I do, az not good fo me. Fo shua, okay fo me fo do all kine stuff, but I no goin let anyting make me do stuff dass not good. Peopo say, “Da food fo da belly, an da belly fo da food.” But no matta -- God goin make all dat pau. But you know, yoa body not fo fool aroun wit da wahines o da guys. You get one body so you can work fo da Boss, an da Boss, he da One dat take care yoa body. God wen make da Boss Jesus come back alive afta he wen mahke, an he get da power fo make us guys come back alive too, afta we mahke. You guys donno dat yoa body stay fo Christ, jalike you guys was da parts a Christʼs body. So now, wat? You guys tink I goin take da parts from Christʼs body, an make um part a one wahineʼs body dat take money fo fool aroun? No way! Not even! You guys neva know dat wen one guy come togedda wit one wahine dat take money fo fool aroun, jalike togedda dey make one body. Da Bible say, “Dem two, togedda dey goin be one body.” 17 But da guy dat stick wit da Boss, jalike togedda dey come one spirit. If you get chance fo fool aroun, run da odda way! All da odda bad kine stuff anybody do, no jam up dea body. But anybody dat go fool aroun, dey do bad kine stuff dat hurt dea own body. How come you guys ack jalike you donno dat yoa body jalike one temple fo Godʼs Good an Spesho Spirit? Godʼs Spirit live inside you guys. God da One wen give his Spirit to you guys. Dass how come you guys not da boss fo yoa own body. Christ wen pay high price fo you guys. So, show respeck fo yoa own body, da way you ack, an dass goin show dat you get respeck fo God. Now I like talk bout da stuff you guys wen aks me inside yoa letta bout da guys an da wahines. Dass good idea, fo one guy no touch one wahine. But get peopo dat like fool aroun, you know. Dass why mo betta every guy get his own wife, an every wahine get her own husban. Da husban gotta give his wife wat she need, an same ting fo da wife. Da wife no ony own her body, but da husban too. Same ting, da husban no ony own his body, but da wife too. No hold back from each odda. You can fo short time, but ony if da husban an da wife tell each odda dey goin hold back fo get time fo pray. An den come back togedda, so da Devil no can make you guys presha make you fool aroun behind da oddaʼs back. But if you no come back togedda fast, you no goin be strong nuff fo say “No!” to da Devil. I no telling you guys guy, no need change da mark. But if you no you gotta hold back, but you can if you like. I tink mo betta, if peopo no marry, jalike me. But every guy get one spesho power dat God wen give um. He give some peopo da power fo handle if dey marry, an odda peopo da power fo handle if dey no marry. I like tell da peopo dat not married an da widows: Mo betta you no marry, jalike me awready. But, if you no can handle, den mo betta get married. Mo betta fo marry den come all hot. I like tell da married peopo dis (but dis come from da Boss Up Dea, not me): Da wife not suppose to leave her husban. O if she leave um, she not suppose to marry again, o she gotta go back wit her husban an make tings good. An da husban not suppose to make his wife go way too. An fo da odda guys, I like tell um dis (dass me talking, not da Boss): If one Christian brudda get one wife dat no trus God, he not suppose to throw her out if she like stay wit him. Same ting, if one wahine get one husban dat no trus God, she not suppose to leave him if he like her stay wit him. Da husban dat no trus God stay spesho fo God still yet, cuz he stay tight wit da wife dat trus God. An da wife dat no trus God stay spesho fo God still yet, cuz she stay tight wit da husban dat trus God. If no was lidat, den dea kids no stay spesho, Da Husban An Da Wife but cuz one a da parents trus God, da kids stay spesho fo God too. But da husban o da wife dat no trus God, if dey like leave, den let um. Da one dat trus God no stay stuck wit da marriage if da one dat no trus God like go. Cuz God wen tell you guys fo come be his guys, so yoa hearts can rest inside. But if you one Christian wahine, you donno if you no can help yoa husban get outa da bad kine stuff. An you brah, if you one Christian guy, you donno if you no can help yoa wife get outa da bad kine stuff. Stick Wit Da Way Da Boss Wen Give You Fo Live 17 But stick wit da way Jesus da Boss wen give you fo live, cuz God wen tell you fo come be his guys. Dis da rule I teach all da church peopo every place. If you get da cut skin mark on top yoa body fo show you one Jew, an den God tell you fo come be his mo da mark, an God wen tell you fo come be his guy, no need cut skin. If you wen cut skin, no matta. If you neva cut skin, no matta, same ting. Main ting, us guys do wat God tell us fo do. Wen God wen tell you fo come wit him an be his guy, he neva say fo change every- ting. Ony stay da way you was. Jalike, if you was one slave wen God wen tell you fo come, no let dat bodda you. If you can get out, den do um. If not, dass okay. If one guy stay one slave, an da Boss tell um fo come be his guy, he stay tight wit da Boss. No matta da guy one slave still yet, now he work fo da Boss Up Dea. An if da guy no was one slave wen da Boss wen tell him fo come, now he one slave fo Christ. Christ wen pay high price fo you guys, you know. So no be one slave fo odda peopo. Eh, bruddas an sistas! Wen God wen tell you guys fo come be his guys, no go make all kine changes. Ony stick wit da way you was. Do um fo God. You guys wen aks me bout da peopo dat neva sleep wit nobody. Da Boss neva tell me how dey gotta make, but dis wat I tink. You can trus wat I say, cuz God, he good to me an give me chance. You know, get plenny trouble an presha now- days. Dass why I tink, mo betta stay da way you was. You get one wife? No throw her out. You no mo one wife? No go looking. But if you marry, you no stay doing notting wrong. If one wahine dat neva marry go marry, she no stay doing notting wrong. But da peopo dat get married goin get problem inside dis world, an I ony trying fo help you guys, so you no suffa. Eh bruddas an sistas! I like say dis: No mo time awready, if you get one wife o you no moa. Cuz da way da world stay now, goin all pau. Same ting if you crying o you not crying, if you stay good inside o you no stay good inside, if you can buy stuff o you no mo notting, 31 o if you use da stuff from dis world, o if you let um go, no big ting. Cuz da way da world stay now, goin all pau. I like you guys no worry. Da guy dat not married, he get mo time fo tink bout da Boss, az why he can do stuff fo make da Boss stay good inside. Da married guy, he gotta tink bout da stuff inside da world too. Az why he no can tink good, cuz he like do good fo his wife, an same time tink bout da Boss. He get two diffren kine tings fo tink bout. Same ting, da wahine dat no mo husban an da wahine dat not married, dey get mo time fo tink bout da Boss, how dey can stay all out fo da Boss, dea spirit, dea body, everyting. But da married wahine gotta tink bout da stuff inside da world too. Az why she no can tink good, cuz she like do good fo her husban, an same time tink bout da Boss. I telling you guys dis stuff, cuz good fo you guys. I no like jam up you guys. I like you guys do da right ting, an know wat da Boss like you fo do an be ready fo do um, an no worry bout odda kine stuffs. If get one guy dat stay ready fo marry one wahine, an he figga he making her wait long time, if she old nuff fo marry awready, go ahead. Marry her, if dass wat you like. Da Peopo Dat Not Married Dass okay, you no doing notting wrong. But if get one guy who know wat he like, an he can handle, an wait, an he stay make up his mind fo no get married, dass okay too. Good ting fo da guy marry her, but mo betta, da guy no get married. Da Widows 39So den, da wife gotta stay wit da husban till he mahke. Afta he mahke, she can marry if she like, but ony if da odda guy stay tight wit da Boss. I figga, I get Godʼs Spirit in charge a me, an dass wat he like me fo say: Mo betta fo her if she no marry. Da Food Dey Give To Da Idol Kine Gods (Da Rules Second Time 4:35,39; 6:4) 1 Now, I like talk bout da meat dat peopo give fo make sacrifice fo da idol kine gods. We all know dat all us guys know plenny bout dis. But you know, if somebody know plenny, dat ony goin make dem tink dey mo smart den anybody. Mo betta get love an aloha fo da odda peopo. Dass wat goin make everybody come mo strong an mo solid inside. Plus, if peopo dat tink dey know somet- ing awready, dey still donno um da way dey suppose to. But if anybody get love an aloha fo God, God know dem, an dass wass importan. So den. Even if da peopo make sacrifice to da idol kine gods, an den somebody go eat dat food, we all know dat da idol kine gods inside dis world not da real God. Jalike den, if I go eat dat stuff, an dat make my da Bible say, “Ony get one God dass fo real, an all da odda gods no mean notting.” 5 Get plenny kine tings inside da sky an inside da world, dat da peopo say dey gods o dey bosses. But fo us guys, ony get one God, Everyting come from him, An ony get one Boss, Wen God wen make everyting, An us guys stay live cuz Jesus wen give us 7 But you know, get peopo dat donno dat. Some peopo, dey still yet tinking everytime bout da idol kine gods, jalike dey wen tink befo time. Dass why, everytime dey eat da meat dat da odda peopo wen use fo make sacrifice fo da idol kine gods, dey tink, “Eh, dis food was one sacrifice fo da idol kine god, you know!” Dey tink, “If I eat get da right fo get stuff fo eat an drink from dis stuff, I stay doing bad kine stuff!” An dat make dem feel all pilau inside so dey no can pray, cuz dey not strong inside. Ho! No mo food dat can make us guys come mo close to God, you know. If we no eat um, dat no make us mo worse. An if we eat um, dat no make us mo betta. But watch out! Jus cuz you get da right fo do someting, dat no mean, dass good dat you do um. If bumbye one brudda o one sista dat no stay strong inside see you do um, an dat goin mess dem up -- den az no good lidat! You, you know dat all dis stuff okay. But if one brudda dat no stay strong inside see you sitting an eating ova dea inside one temple fo one idol kine god, wat you tink he stay tinking? Fo shua, da guy goin tink dass okay fo him fo eat da food too, from da sacrifice dey wen kill fo da idol kine god. You know plenny, but you goin make da guy dat no stay strong inside wipe out if you do dat. An dat guy, he one Christian brudda, an Godʼs Spesho Guy wen go mahke fo him, an den! You know wat? If dass how you guys stay do bad kine ting agains yoa bruddas an sistas, you hurt dem wen dey no stay strong inside. Eh! dass jalike you guys wen do bad kine ting agains Godʼs Spesho Guy Christ! So Christian brudda o sista jam up, mo betta I no goin eat dat kine meat, eva! Cuz I no like dem come all jam up inside. He our Fadda. Wen God Send Guys All Ova, He Give Dem Rights An us guys do everyting fo him. (Da Rules Second Time 25:4) 1 Tink bout dis: I can do anyting. God Dass Jesus Christ. wen send me all ova da place fo tell peopo bout him. I wen see Jesus, our Boss. I stay Jesus da One wen do um, tight wit da Boss, an all you guys wen trus Christ cuz a da work I wen do. Even if life. get odda peopo, God neva send me fo talk to dem. But fo shua, he wen send me fo talk to you guys. If you like proof dat God wen send me, ony gotta check out wat wen happen to you guys now, how you guys stay tight wit da Boss! Fo da guys dat like poin finga me, I like tell um dis: 4 You no tink me an Barnabas da peopo we teach? You no tink we get da right fo take one Christian wife wit us wen we go some odda place? Da odda guys God send all ova da place, dey do dat, you know, an da Bossʼs brudda guys, an Peter. O you guys tink dat ony me an Barnabas, we da ony guys dat no mo da right fo work fo make money so we can teach peopo? Eh, look da army guys. Dey no gotta buy dea own food an clotheses. An da guys dat plant da grape, nobody goin tell dem, “No eat da grape!” Da sheep farma guy too, az okay fo him fo use da milk from da sheeps. You guys tink I say all dis stuff, cuz I talking jalike da odda peopo? Godʼs Rules say da same ting, you know. Inside da Bible, da Rules dat God wen tell Moses fo write, talk lidis: “Wen da cow stay working fo smash da wheat so you can take out da junks, you no go tie up his mout so he no can eat da wheat.” You tink God wen say dat ony cuz he like take care da cows so dey can eat, o wat? Mo like he talking bout us guys too, fo help us! Yeah, he say dat fo us guys. He say, “Da guy dat plow da groun, an da guy dat take da junks outa da grain, wen dey work, dey gotta wait still yet fo eat. But dey know, bumbye dey goin get dea share.” 11 You know, wen us guys wen teach you guys stuff from Godʼs Spirit, dass jalike wen one farma guy stay planting stuff. So az notting, wen us guys pau teach, den we get food fo eat from you guys. Get odda guys dat get da same right fo get food an stuff from you guys wen dey teach, yeah? So, wat bout us guys? We get plenny mo rights den dem. But you know, us guys, we neva use da rights we get. Mo betta we take any kine, fo no jam up you guys. Cuz den, you like listen to da Good Kine Stuff Bout Christ dat we telling you guys. Tink bout dis: da priest guys dat stay work inside da Jewish temple, dey get dea food from da sacrifices da peopo bring to da temple. Da guys dat stay kill da animals on top da altar fo sacrifice, dey can eat da meat dat da peopo give fo sacrifice. Same ting, da Boss wen tell us guys dat da guys dat stay tell da Good Kine Stuff Bout Christ, dey suppose to get all da stuffs dey need fo live, from dea work. Me, I get da rights fo get all dat, but I neva like do um lidat. I no write dis letta fo make you guys give me stuff. I figga, mo betta I mahke, den let somebody tink dat I no mo da right fo talk lidis. Jus cuz I stay telling peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God, dat no mean I can talk big bout myself. I gotta tell um bout God. Auwe fo me if I no tell peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God! If I wen do all dis stuff ony cuz I like, den da stuffs I get, jalike da money I get fo do one job. But if I go do um cuz I gotta do um, den, jalike God stay trus me fo take care his stuffs fo him. So den, wat kine pay I goin get fo do all dat? I no need pay! I ony like tell peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God. I do um lidat an no charge notting. Dat make me feel good, jalike wen one guy get pay fo work. I do um an no need use all da rights dat I get cuz I stay telling da Good Kine Stuff From God. I can do watevas how I like, an no mo nobody can tell me how I gotta ack. But you know wat? Jalike I wen go make myself jalike one slave guy, so everybody can tell me wat fo do. Wen I make lidat, I can help mo plenny peopo fo know God, az why. Fo da Jewish peopo, I wen make jalike I one Jewish guy, fo help da Jewish peopo fo know God. Fo da peopo dat tink dey gotta stick wit Godʼs Rules, I do wat Godʼs Rules say, so I can help dem fo know God too, no matta I know dat I no gotta do wat Godʼs Rules say fo get um right wit him. Fo da peopo dat donno Godʼs Rules, I wen come jalike dem, fo bring to God da peopo dat donno Godʼs Rules. (Dat no mean, dat I no stay doing wat Godʼs Rules say, you know. I Christʼs guy, an dass how come I stay do wat Godʼs Rules say.) 22 Fo da peopo dat no stay strong inside, I make myself jalike I no stay strong inside too, so I can bring dem close to God. Fo everybody, I like come jalike dem, so no matta wat, I goin help some peopo fo get outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in. I stay doing all dis tings so everybody can trus da Good Kine Stuff From God, an all us guys can get all da good kine tings dat God like give us. You guys know wat happen wen plenny runnas run in one race, yeah? Ev- erybody run, but ony one guy win da first place medal. So den, go fo da win, fo God! All da guys in da race, dey stay do ony wat da coach tell um, yeah? An dey do all dat ony fo get one head lei dat goin come mahke latas. But us guys, wat we goin get no goin come poho eva. Me, I like run an go strait fo da finish! Jalike wen I boxing, I no punch da air! Jalike I make my body tough, an I work um hard. No good, if I tell all da odda peopo bout God, an den I mess up, so God gotta throw me outa da race. Watch Out Fo Da Idol Kine Gods! (Outa Egypt 13:21-22; 14:21-22; 16:4-5; 17:1- 7; 32:1-6; Da Census 11:4-6; 20:2-17; 25:1,9) 1 Eh, bruddas an sistas! Dis one ting you guys gotta know: Befo time, our ancesta guys wen stay unda da cloud God wen send, an God wen open da Red Sea from one side to da odda side, an dey all wen walk thru on top da sea bottom to da odda side. Dass jalike one picha, da cloud an da Red Sea. Cuz da peopo wen trus Moses fo be dea leada, an wen go unda da cloud an inside da sea wit him. Dass jalike us guys trus Christ, an get baptize fo show dat we his guys, an follow him. All da peopo wen eat da same food dat Godʼs Spirit wen give um, 4 an dey all wen drink da same water dat Godʼs Spirit wen give um fo drink. Wat dey wen drink, wen come outa one big rock dat Godʼs Spirit wen give um. Jalike dat rock was dea every place dey go, Christ was dea too. But God neva like how mos a da peopo wen ack. So dey wen mahke, an dea bodies dey wen bury, all da diffren places wea dey wen go. All dat stuff wen happen fo show us guys dat we not suppose to go all out fo do da bad kine stuff, jalike all da peopo dea. No good we pray to da idol kine gods, jalike some a da peopo. Da Bible say dis: “Da peopo wen party in front da baby cow kine god statue, an afta, dey wen start fo fool aroun.” 8 No good we go fool aroun wit peopo dat we not married to. Dat time, some a da peopo wen make lidat, an dey all wen mahke die dead, twenty three tousand a dem. No good we try fo find out how plenny bad kine stuff us guys can do befo da Boss punish us. Some a da peopo wen do dat, an God wen send snakes ova dea fo bite um an wipe um out. No good we grumble. Some a da peopo wen grumble ova an ova, an da Killa Angel Guy wen go wipe um out. All dat stuff wen happen to da Is- rael peopo fo show us guys someting, you know. Dey wen write um all down so us guys can learn wat kine ting we betta not do. Cuz da last times stay coming. Eh! You tink you stay strong now. But you gotta watch out so you no do bad kine stuff. Wen you guys get chance fo do da bad kine stuff, dass da same ting, jalike you stay tight wit da bad kine spirits. Come wat happen to all da odda peopo. But you know, you guys can trus God fo do wat he say. He no goin let you guys get so plenny presha dat you guys no can handle. Everytime get presha lidat, God goin make um so you guys can get outa dat. He goin make you guys strong fo handle, an no fall down. So, my good friends, weneva some- body try make you guys go down an pray in front da idol kine gods, run da odda way quick! I telling you dis, cuz I know you guys can tink strait. So go check um out yoaself, wat I telling you is da trut. Tink bout dis: wen us guys take da communion cup, an tell God he good heart fo give um to us guys -- dat mean, dat all us guys stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy Christ, an wen he wen go bleed an mahke, was jalike us guys wen mahke too. Wen we broke da bread, dat mean same ting - - us guys all stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy Christ, an dat time he wen mahke, was jalike us guys wen mahke too. Us guys togedda get one bread. Wen everybody take one piece from da one bread, dat mean all us guys jalike we stay one body all togedda, no matta we plenny peopo. Tink bout how da Israel peopo do um: wen dey kill da animal on top da altar fo make da sacrifice fo God, da priest guys dat kill um get da meat fo eat. Dat mean dat dey all stay tight togedda wit God an wit da peopo dat wen bring da animal fo da sacrifice. But you tink I mean dat da sacrifice dey make fo da idol kine gods, dass somet- ing fo real? Nah! Da idol kine god statue, dass notting! Dis wat I mean: wen da peopo dat donno God kill da animals fo make sacrifice, dey do um fo da bad kine spirits, dey no stay do um fo da real God. But I no like you guys come tight wit da bad kine spirits! You guys, you no can drink from da communion cup dat show you da Bossʼs guys, an same time, you stay drinking from one diffren kine cup dat show dat you stay tight wit da bad kine spirits. You guys no can eat da food from da table dat show you da Bossʼs guys, an same time, you stay eating da food dat show dat on now! Wat you guys tink? We goin make da Boss come huhu wit us, o wat? No good, lidat. O, you tink us guys mo strong den him? Do Everyting Fo Show How Awesome God Stay 23 I can do all kine stuff, but everyting not good fo me. I can do all kine stuff, but dat no make nobody come mo strong inside. Mo betta, we no try fo do ony da stuff dat us guys like. Mo betta, we do da stuff dat help da odda peopo too. So den. Go eat da meat dey sell inside da meat market, an no go aks, “Dis okay fo me fo eat, o wat?” 26 Da Bible wen say, “Da Boss, he own da world, an everyting inside da world too,” you know. If one guy dat no trus God tell you guys, “Come our house fo eat!” an you guys like go, den eat everyting dey give you, an no go aks, “Az okay fo me fo eat dis, o wat?” 28 (But, if somebody tell you guys, “Dis meat come from one temple sacrifice fo one idol kine god,” den no eat um. You guys gotta tink bout da guy who wen tell you dat, if okay o not okay. I mean, tink bout wat da odda guy stay tinking, if okay fo him fo eat um. No tink ony bout wass okay fo you.) But eh! I can do wat I like. Still yet, if one odda guy tink dat not okay fo him fo do dis ting, an az bad fo him, how come I no can do wat I like, jus cuz da odda guy tink az bad fo him? If I eat da stuff an tell God “Mahalo plenny!” how come peopo talk stink bout me? Everyting you guys do, eat, drink, wateva -- do um all fo show how awesome God stay. No go jam up nobody -- da Jewish peopo, o da peopo dat not Jewish, o da church peopo who come togedda fo God. Make jalike me: I try make all dose guys stay good inside. I no stay try fo ony do wass good fo me. I stay try fo do wass good fo all da odda peopo, so dey can get outa da bad kine stuff dey stay in too. An stay do. Cuz I trying fo copy Christ, jalike he wen do. Wen Dey Pray? I get someting I like tell you folks -- you all good guys, cuz you guys tink bout me all da time, no matta wat. All da stuff I wen teach you guys, you guys still yet stay do um. Right on! But no foget da ting you guys awready know: Da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, Christ, he stay in charge. He stay in charge a every man, jalike da head stay in charge a da body. Same ting fo da wahine, da husban stay in charge a her, jalike he da head fo her. An same ting wit God, he stay in charge a Christ, jalike he da head fo Christ. If get one guy dat cover up his head wen he pray o talk fo God, dass jalike he do one shame kine ting dat make Christ shame. Cuz Christ stay in charge a dat guy, he da head fo him. But if get one wahine dat no cover up her head wen she pray o talk fo God, dass jalike she do one shame kine ting dat make her husban shame. Cuz same ting, he stay in charge a her, an he da head fo her. Same ting, dass jalike if somebody wen cut her hair bolohead fo make her shame. If da wahine no like cover up her head, den mo betta she cut off all her hair. But you know, if goin be shame fo her wen she cut her hair bolohead, mo betta cover up her head, yeah? Tink bout dis: Da man betta not cover up his head, you know. Cuz God wen make da man look jalike him, an da man show how awesome God stay. An da wahine show how awesome da man stay. Wen God wen make da world, he neva make da man from da wahine, you know. He wen make da wahine from da man. An he neva make da man fo help da wahine. He wen make da wahine fo help da man. Az why da wahine suppose to put someting on top her head, so everybody goin know dat she get da right fo pray an talk fo God -- even da angel guys inside da sky goin know. But wen dey stay tight wit da Boss, da wahine no do notting by herself, an da man no do notting by himself. God wen make da wahine outa da man, first time. But afta, 11 every man born from da wahine. An God, you guys, go copy me, jalike how I he da One dat wen make everyting happen lidat. You guys, figga dis yoa own self: Wen How Come Da Wahines Cover Up Dea Head one wahine pray to God, an she no use notting fo cover up her head, you tink dat okay, o wat? Da way you guys tink Corint side, if one guy get long hair, jalike az shame fo him, yeah? But if da wahine get long hair, dat make her look awesome, yeah? Fo her, God wen give her da long hair fo cover up her head jalike how suppose to. But if anybody like argue bout dis, dey gotta figga lidis: all us leada guys an da church peopo all ova, dass da way we do um. Wat I goin say now, I no can say notting good bout you guys. Weneva you guys come togedda, dat no make you guys mo betta. You come mo worse, brah! first ting, wen you guys come togedda fo church, I hear dis: you guys all split up.body no mean notting spesho fo me.” Dass I figga, dis ting I hear, must be dass true. jalike dey aksing fo trouble, cuz dey goin 19 (Fo shua, if get presha fo you guys split get punish fo eat an drink lidat. Az why, up, den you can find out who listen to da Boss, an who no listen.) 20 Cuz wen you guys come togedda fo eat, dat wen mahke awready. But if we wen suppose to be fo rememba da Boss Jesus. But you guys no do dat. Cuz nobody share, az why. Dey eat dea own food, so get guys, you know, he do dat fo teach us guys guys dat stay hungry, an get odda guys, dey da right way. He no like us get punish an get drunk. Eh! You guys no mo house fo go eat an drink inside? O you guys tink bumbye. da odda peopo dat come togedda fo church, dey junk? Da peopo dat no mo notting, you guys make um feel shame! So, wat you guys like me say? Dass okay fo you guys fo make betta dey stay home eat. No good you guys lidat? No way! Not even!.:14-20) 23 You know, was da Boss Jesus wen tell me bout dis, an I wen tell um all to you guys. Da Boss Jesus, dat same nite befo dey wen set um up fo kill um, he wen pick up one bread. He wen tell God “Mahalo plenny!” an broke um. Den he say, “Eat dis know bout da tings dat Godʼs bread. Dis, my body. Dey goin broke um, an us guys da power fo do. You guys know dat goin be fo you guys, fo rememba me.” awready, dat befo you guys was Godʼs 25 Same ting afta dey wen eat, he wen peopo, all da time someting wen make you take da wine cup, an he wen say, “Dis cup guys go afta da idol kine gods3 dat no can mean dat God wen make one new kine deal even talk, an pray to dem. Dass why I fo you guys, an I gotta bleed an mahke like make shua you guys know dat nobody fo make um happen lidat. Weneva you dat stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Spirit goin guys drink um, do um fo rememba me. say, “Jesus stay damn!” An nobody goin 26 Everytime you guys eat dis bread an say “Jesus stay da Boss” if dey no stay tight drink outa dis cup, till I come back, dass wit Godʼs Spesho Spirit. jalike you guys telling da story one mo time bout me yoa Boss, how I wen mahke.” 27 Dat mean, anybody dat go eat da bread da worka guys get da same Boss. God an drink outa da cup fo rememba da Boss, make all diffren kine tings happen fo all da but inside, dea heart not okay, God goin diffren peopo, but get da same God dat stay punish dem. Cuz az da Boss Jesus body an making everyting happen fo everybody. his blood, you know, an dass jalike dey no mo respeck, an make um any kine jalike doing, dass fo help everybody togedda. How Fo Make Wen You Eat Da Bossʼs Food was notting. Mo betta, first ting, every- body check out how dey stay inside. If dey stay okay inside, den dey can eat da bread an drink outa da cup. But anybody eat o drink an dey tinking, “No mo diffrence, you know, dat Jesus wen mahke. Da Boss Jesus get plenny peopo ova dea by you guys, dat no stay strong, an dey sick, an get peopo check out our own self first, den we no goin get punish lidat. Wen da Boss punish us wipe out wit all da peopo inside da world, 33 So den, bruddas an sistas. Wen you guys come togedda fo eat, wait fo each odda. But if anybody stay hungry, mo come togedda, jus fo get punish. An all da odda tings you guys wen aks bout, bumbye Da Bread An Da Wine Fo Rememba Da Boss I goin tell you guys how fo make um wen I (Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke come dea. Da Tings Dat Godʼs Spirit Give Us Guys Da Power Fo Do 1 Eh, bruddas an sistas, I like you guys 24 Spirit give 4 Godʼs Spirit give diffren peopo da power fo do all diffren kine tings, but all dat come from da same Spirit. Get If Yoa Heart Not Okay Inside, No Eat diffren kine ways fo work fo God, but all 7 God show everybody wat his Spirit stay 8 He give his Spirit to some guys fo give dem da power fo tell odda peopo wass da bestes ting fo do. Fo odda guys, da same Spesho Spirit give um da power so dey can tell wat dey undastan. He give odda peopo da power fo trus God plenny, cuz dey stay tight wit his Spirit. Odda peopo, dey can make da sick peopo come good. An odda peopo, God give um da power fo do awesome kine stuff dat show Godʼs power. Fo odda peopo, he give um da power fo talk fo God, an oddas, he give um da power fo figga wat spirits come from God an wat spirits not from God. Oddas can talk diffren kine languages. Oddas can tell wat da diffren languages mean. Da same Spirit, he do all dis. He give everybody da power fo do da ting dat he like dat guy fo do. ony get one body, an inside da body, get plenny parts. No matta get plenny parts inside da body, ony get one body. an his ohana. Us guys stay tight wit da one Spirit. Dass why, wen us guys wen get baptize, we all come jalike we one peopo. No matta we Jewish o not, no matta we gotta work like slaves o not, God wen give all us guys da One Spirit, jalike we all drink power. Odda peopo can make da sick peopo water from da same puka. get plenny diffren parts. Wat if yoa foot wen go say, “Me, I not one hand, so gotta be, I not from dis guyʼs body!” You tink dat mean da foot not from da guyʼs body? No way! An wat if yoa ear wen go say, “Me, I not one eye, so gotta be, I not from dis guyʼs Nah. He make everybody teacha guys? body!” Same ting, you tink dat mean dat da ear not from da guyʼs body? Not even! If all yoa body was one eye, how you goin hear? If all yoa body was one ear, how you goin smell? But you know, God wen make our body one ting, an he wen put all diffren kine parts inside, jalike he wen like. If our whole body was jus one part, den no mo body, yeah? But fo real kine, our body get plenny parts, an dass wat make da whole body one ting. you, you know!” Da head no can tell da foot, “I no need you, you know!” 22 Get tings inside da body dat us guys figga not so strong, but eh! we need um. Get odda tings inside da body dat us guys figga not importan, but eh! we take good care dem. An get tings inside da body, we figga dey not fo show, so we make um so dey look okay. Da tings inside da body dat look okay, no need do notting fo dem. But you know, wen God wen put everyt- ing togedda fo make da body, he wen take da tings dat not so importan an make um importan, 25 cuz he no like da body be all split up. He like everyting inside da body fo work togedda wit each odda, same same. If one part a da body suffa, all da odda parts suffa, same time. If one part a da body stay awesome, all da odda parts feel good, same time. Inside One Body Get Plenny Diffren Parts 12 Same ting wit da body, you know. You 27 Same ting wit you guys. You jalike Christʼs body. Everybody jalike one part inside Christʼs body. From all da peopo dat come togedda fo church, da numba Same ting wit Godʼs Spesho Guy Christ one importan ting, God send some guys all ova da place fo tell wat he wen say. Numba two, he make some peopo his talka guys. Numba three, he make some peopo teachas. Den, he give some peopo da power fo do all kine awesome stuff dat show Godʼs come good. Odda peopo can help. Odda 14 Inside our body, no mo jus one part -- peopo can put tings togedda strait. An odda peopo, he give um da power so dey can talk diffren kine languages. Now, wat you guys tink? God send ev- erybody all ova da place fo tell wat he wen say? Nah. He make everybody talk fo him? Nah. He make everybody do awesome kine stuff? Nah. He give everybody da power fo make da sick peopo come good? Nah. He make everybody so dey can talk diffren kine languages? Nah. He make everybody so dey can tell wat da diffren kine language mean? Nah. Now, you guys go all out so you guys can handle da mos importan stuff God give you. Da eye no can tell da hand, “I no need Still yet, I like show you guys da bestes way fo live: 1 If I wen talk all da diffren kine lan- guages, da peopo kine language an even da angel kine languages, but I no mo love an aloha, wat den? I ony talking rubbish kine, jalike one junk kine bell o one kalangalang cymbal. An if I was one talka fo God, an I wen know all kine secret stuffs an all da kine stuffs dat da smart guys know, an if I wen trus God all da way so I can even make da mountains move, but I no mo love an aloha, wat den? I worth notting, dass wat. If I wen sell all my stuffs an use da money fo give food to da poor peopo, an even sacrifice my body in da fire, but I no mo love an aloha, wat den? Poho, wase time! Wen you get love an aloha, you can handle all kine pilikia an hang in dea long time. You get good heart fo help da odda peopo. You no get jealous cuz da odda guy get someting you like. Wen you get love an aloha, you no need talk big. You no mo big head. You no ack pilau kine. You no ack like everybody gotta do everyting yoa way. You no get huhu fast. Wen you get love an aloha, you no goin rememba all da bad kine stuff peopo wen do to you. You no feel good inside wen somebody do someting dass wrong, but you feel plenny good inside wen somebody tell da trut. Wen you get love an aloha, you can hang in dea fo everyting an no give up eva. You always trus God bout everyting. You know everyting goin come okay bumbye. You can stand strong everytime. Wen you get love an aloha, dat no goin pau eva. Da guys dat talk fo God, bumbye no need fo da tings dey say. Wen peopo talk diffren kine, bumbye nobody goin talk lidat. Da stuff da smart guys know, no matta, bumbye no need. You know, we ony know litto bit. Wen we talk fo God, we get ony litto bit fo tell. Bumbye, goin wat da guy mean wen he talking lidat. Den come da time wen everyting stay perfeck. Dat time, no need fo da litto bit kine stuff no moa. Small kid time, I wen talk jalike one small kid. I wen tink jalike one small kid. I wen figga everyting jalike one small kid. Now, I big, dass why I no do da tings da same way da small kids do um. 12 Right now, us guys can see stuff, but ony jalike wit one junk mirror. Hard fo Love an Aloha figga wat we see dea. But bumbye, goin be clear. Us guys goin see everyting jalike was right dea in front our face. Right now, I ony know litto bit. But bumbye, I goin undastan everyting, jalike God undastan everyting bout me. So now, get three tings dat stay: we can trus God, an we can know everyting goin come out okay bumbye, an we get love an aloha. From da three tings, da love an aloha kine, dass da main ting, an da bestes way. Diffren Kine Tings Dat Godʼs Spirit Let Peopo Do (Isaiah 28:11-12) 1 Go all out fo get love an aloha. An geev um so Godʼs Spirit give you da power fo do all kine tings. But you know wat kine power you need da mos? Da main ting, you need da power fo talk fo God. Cuz you know, wen one guy talk diffren kine language, Godʼs Spirit giving him da power fo tell stuff dat still yet stay secret. But da guy no stay talking to da peopo dea. He talking to God. No mo nobody dea undastan da guy. But da guy dat talk fo God, ho! he stay talking to da peopo dea. He making um mo strong inside, an he giving um good kine words, an he kokua dem. Da guy dat talking diffren kine language, he ony making himself mo strong inside. But da talka fo God, he make all da peopo dat come togedda fo church mo strong an solid inside. I wen like all you guys talk diffren kine language, you know. But mo betta, I like you talk fo God. Da guy dat talk fo God, he mo importan den da guy dat talk diffren kine language. But dass okay fo talk diffren kine language, if you get somebody fo tell all da odda peopo dat come togedda fo church goin come mo strong inside, cuz dey all undastan. Kay den, bruddas an sistas! Tink bout dis. If I come by you guys, an I stay talking diffren kine language, how dat goin help you guys, aah? Ony get one way I goin help you guys. Wen I talk to you guys, I gotta tell you guys someting God like you fo know, dat was secret befo time, o help you guys undastan someting, o tell you guys wat God say, o teach, yeah? Same ting, you know, wit da music instrument. Dey not alive, but dey make sound. Da flute o da guitar o wateva, if dey no can change da note, how anybody goin figga wat song dey playing? No can. An if da bugle make funny kine noise, how da army guys goin know wen dey suppose to get ready fo fight, aah? No can. Fo you guys, same ting wen you stay talking diffren kine language -- if you no say stuff dass easy fo peopo fo undastan, you know, you ony talking to da air. Get plenny diffren kine languages hea inside da world, an every language let da peopo tell an undastan wat dey mean. But if I donno wat dea language mean, da peopo dat stay talking lidat, I goin know dat dey not from my peopo, an dey goin know dat I not from dea peopo. Same ting wit you guys -- you like so plenny fo get power from Godʼs Spirit. Kay den. Mo betta go all out fo get da kine power dat goin help all da peopo dat come togedda fo church come mo strong inside! So den, da guy dat stay talking diffren kine language, he suppose to aks God fo da power fo tell wat he mean wen he stay talking da odda language. Me, if I stay talking diffren kine lan- guage wen I pray, I stay praying inside my heart, but I not tinking inside my head. So, wat I suppose to do, aah? I goin pray how I like pray inside my heart, plus, I goin tink inside my head how I goin pray, same time. I goin sing fo God how I like sing inside my heart, plus, I goin tink how I goin sing, same time. If you tell inside yoa heart how good God stay an you using diffren kine language, an get one guy inside da meeting dat no undastan wat you saying, how he goin say “Dass right!” wen you tell God, “Mahalo plenny!” wit da odda language? He no can, cuz he no undastan. Fo shua, you do good job wen you tell God “Mahalo plenny!” wit diffren kine language. But dat no help da odda guy fo come mo strong inside. You know, I talk diffren kine language mo plenny den all you guys, an I tank God fo dat. But wen I come togedda wit Godʼs peopo fo church, mo betta I say ony litto bit dat peopo can undastan, so I can teach dem. Dass mo betta den if I say uku paila words, talking diffren kine language dat dey no can undastan, yeah? Eh, bruddas an sistas! No go tink jalike small kids! (Fo do da bad kine stuff, shua! Ack jalike babies! Cuz da babies, dey donno how fo do bad kine stuff.) But fo undastan wass da main ting, you gotta grow up! God say dis inside his Rules: “I goin try talk to dese peopo Wit peopo dat talk odda kine lan- guages. But no matta wat I do, dey no goin listen. Dass wat da Boss say.” 22 An dat mean, wen peopo talk diffren kine language, dass jalike one sign fo da peopo dat no trus God, so dey know wat God can do. Dat kine talk, not fo help da peopo dat trus God awready. But wen God make peopo talk fo him, dass fo help da peopo dat trus God, not fo da peopo dat no trus him. So, wat? If all you guys come togedda fo church, an you all talking diffren kine language, an get some peopo dat come inside dea dat no mo da power fo undastan dat kine talk, o some peopo dat no trus God, wat dey goin say? Dey goin say, “Dese peopo hea, get some spirit dat wen take ova dem, an dey pupule, fo shua!” 24 But if all you guys stay talking fo God, an one guy dat no trus God come inside dea, o one guy dat no mo da power fo undastan da diffren kine language, dat guy goin listen to da tings everybody telling. Wat da talka guys say goin make proof to him dat he wen do bad kine stuffs, jalike dey was all judges an know everyting bout him awready. Cuz da secret kine tings dat da guy no like nobody know, he try hide um inside his heart, but no can, cuz dat stuff goin come outside an everybody goin know. Den he goin go down on his face an give God love an respeck, an tell everybody, “Fo shua, God stay wit you guys!” Do Everyting Da Right Way 26 Kay den, bruddas an sistas. Wen you guys come togedda, everybody get somet- ing -- one song bout God, o someting fo teach, o fo tell someting dat God like tell dat was secret befo time, o someting fo say talking diffren kine language, o dey can tell wat da odda peopo wen mean wen dey wen talk diffren kine language. Everyting dey do, gotta be fo make each odda come mo strong inside. If somebody like talk diffren kine language, dass all right, but ony two o three lidat an no moa. One guy no can start till da odda guy pau, an gotta get somebody fo tell wat dey mean wen dey talk diffren kine language lidat. An if no mo nobody fo tell wat dey mean, den dey not suppose to talk diffren kine language in front da church peopo. Dey ony suppose to talk diffren kine language inside dea own heart, an dey can talk to God lidat too. Da peopo dat like talk fo God, same ting: two o three guys can talk fo God, an da odda peopo gotta check out how fo do wat dey saying fo demself. But if get one nodda guy dat stay sitting dea, an God show dat guy someting dat was secret befo, an now da guy like tell wat God show um, den da guy dat stay talking fo God suppose to stop. All you guys can talk fo God, first one guy den one nodda, you know. Dat way, all you guys goin learn someting, an all you guys goin get good kine words fo feel mo betta. Da guys dat talk fo God, wen dey get da power from da Spirit fo talk fo God lidat, dey still stay in charge a wat dey say. Cuz God, he no make us jam up everybody. He make everyting run smooth. All ova da place, weaeva da peopo dat stay spesho fo God come togedda fo church, get dis custom: 34 Da wahines suppose to stay quiet wen everybody come togedda fo church. Dey not suppose to talk. Dey suppose to show respeck fo da leada guy. Godʼs Rules say da same ting, yeah? Wen dey get questions, dey can aks dea husbans wen dey go home. Shame, aah? if da wahines stay talking wen Godʼs peopo come togedda fo church! Wot! If you guys no like, try tink bout good nuff fo peopo call me one messenja dis: Who was da guys dat wen start fo tell wat God say, first time? Was you guys? Nah! O you guys tink you da ony peopo dat eva hear wat God say? Get real! Anybody figga dey one talka fo God, o day stay tight wit da Spirit, dey gotta know dis: Da stuff I writing to you guys, dass da stuff dat da Boss wen tell us guys we gotta do. Anybody no listen to dat, den you guys, no listen to dem. Bruddas an sistas, all dis mean: -- go all out fo talk fo God! An no go tell peopo dey no can talk diffren kine languages. But wen you guys come togedda, gotta do one ting first, an afta, da nex ting. Gotta do everyting da right way. Christ Wen Come Back Alive Afta He Wen Mahke 1 Eh, bruddas an sistas! I like you guys fo rememba da Good Kine Stuff From God dat I wen tell you first time. You guys wen learn um good, an you standing strong cuz you stick wit um. If you guys hang in dea wit da Good Kine Stuff From God dat I wen tell you guys awready, dass how you guys goin get outa da bad kine stuff you stay in. Ony if you guys no hang in dea, den was wase time, an you guys trus God fo notting. From all da stuffs I wen learn first, an den I wen tell you guys, dis da main ting: Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, he wen mahke cuz us guys was doing bad kine stuff, jalike da Bible wen say befo time. Dey wen bury him. Den, day numba three, Christ wen come back alive, jalike da Bible wen say befo time. Den Christ wen let Peter see him, an den his Twelve Guys wen see him. Afta dat, mo den five hundred bruddas an sistas was togedda, an he wen let all dem see him. Mos a dem stay alive still yet, ony some a dem wen mahke awready. Den Christ wen let James see him, an afta, all da guys he wen send all ova da place, dey wen see him too. Me, I was da last guy fo see Christ. Jalike I da baby dat wen born late. You know, dem odda guys dat Christ wen send all ova da place, dey all mo importan den me. I even wen go try fo hurt da church peopo dat come togedda fo God. Dass why I not guy fo God. But God, he so good to me! He wen make me how I stay now. An he neva wase time wen he wen do so plenny good stuff fo me. Afta he wen do um, den I wen work mo hard den all da odda guys. But no was me -- was God, you know, dat wen do all da good tings fo me, an he stay working inside me still yet. But no matta me o da odda guys, we all teach da same ting. Everytime we tell da peopo da Good Stuff From God. An dass wat you guys wen trus. Kay den. Wen us guys teach bout Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, we tell everybody he wen come back alive afta he wen mahke, yeah? So how come, get some a you guys, dat tell, “No, da mahke guys, dey no goin come back alive, you know.” Wot! Eh! If da peopo dat mahke no goin come back alive, dat mean, Christ neva come back alive, too! An if Christ neva come back alive, den all da stuff us guys stay telling da peopo, dat no mean notting, an wase time if you guys trus him.-16 Plus, dat show dat us guys bulai wen we tell peopo how God stay, cuz we tell um dis bout God: “He wen make Christ come back alive afta he wen mahke.” Dass wat we tell um. But if da mahke peopo no can come back alive, den gotta be, God neva make Christ come back alive, cuz Christ wen mahke. Try tink bout dis: if Christ neva come back alive afta he wen mahke, den you guys ony wase time fo trus God. Cuz you guys stay stuck still yet wit da shame fo all da bad kine stuff you guys wen do! Same ting wit da odda peopo dat wen stay tight wit Christ befo time an den wen mahke -- if Christ neva come back from mahke, dey stay cut off from God too! Us guys stay shua dat Christ goin do good tings fo us. But if we can ony tink lidat fo da time wen we stay hea inside dis world, den eh! poho us guys! Den everybody goin pity us mo plenny den all da odda peopo inside da world! Back Alive 20 Eh! But not lidat, you know! Godʼs Spesho Guy Christ, he wen come back alive afta he wen mahke! He jalike da first fruit dey pick from da farm, an plenny mo goin come afta. Christ, he da first guy dat eva wen come back alive afta he wen mahke, an goin get plenny mo mahke peopo dat goin come back alive bumbye, same ting. Had one guy Adam jalike us guys, dat wen do someting bad, an dat make all us odda guys mahke. An had one nodda guy Christ jalike us guys, dat wen do someting good, an cuz a dat, da mahke peopo goin come back alive! Cuz everybody, dey Adam kine guys, an dass why dey all gotta mahke. Same ting, everybody dat stay tight wit Da Mahke Guys Goin Come Back Alive Christ, God goin make dem come alive. But everyting gotta happen da right time, you know. Christ, he da first guy dat wen come back alive, jalike da first fruit dey pick from da farm. Bumbye, wen Christ come back hea, his peopo goin come back alive too. An afta, everyting goin pau. Dat time, Christ da King goin wipe out all da spirits dat say, “Me, I da leada! I stay in charge a everyting! I get da right fo make how I like! I strong!” Same time, Christ da King goin turn ova everyting to God his fadda. Christ gotta stay da King, you know, till God bus up all da peopo dat go agains Christ, an show dat Christ da winna ova dem. An get one nodda ting dat stay agains us guys -- we gotta mahke. Dass da last ting God goin wipe out. Den from dat time, nobody gotta mahke. Da Bible wen say befo time, “God make his Spesho Guy be da boss ova everyting.” But you know, wen he say “everyting get him fo boss” -- fo shua, he not talking bout God, da One dat wen make him be da boss ova everyting. But bumbye, afta Godʼs Boy come da boss fo everyting fo real kine, den, he goin turn ova everyting to God, da One dat wen make him be da boss fo everyting. Den God goin stay in charge a everyting, fo everybody. Da Peopo Who No Stay Shua Dat Christ Wen Come Back Alive 29 If no was lidat, how come get guys dat go get baptize fo da mahke guys? If da mahke guys no goin come back alive Wat Goin Happen Cuz Christ Wen Come fo shua, how come dey getting baptize fo da mahke guys? An us guys, how come we risking our life everytime, if da mahke guys no goin come back alive? Same ting, every day I stay shua dat I risking my life! But I swear to God, bruddas an sistas, no bodda me if I mahke. I real proud a you guys, you know, cuz I stay tight wit our Boss Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. No matta I fight guys dat ack jalike wild animals Efesus side, dass okay! But if I ony do um all by myself, an not fo God, wase time, you know. If da peopo dat mahke no goin come back alive, den mo betta us guys figga jalike da peopo talk, “Eh! Eat plenny! Drink up! Cuz tomorrow we all goin mahke die dead!”. Eh! No go tink da wrong ting lidat! Jalike dey tell, “You hang out wit da bad kine guys, dat going mess you up from being one good guy!” 34 Wise up! Make like you suppose to! Stop doing da bad kine stuff! Cuz even get some peopo dat donno God, you know. I talking lidis fo make you guys shame. Back Alive? But somebody goin aks, “How da mahke guys goin come back alive bumbye? Wat kine body dey goin get?” 36 You aks lidat, fo shua you not tinking. Wen you plant one seed, da seed gotta mahke first, yeah? Ony afta dat, can come alive an grow. Wen you plant um, you not planting someting dat look like da ting dat goin grow, yeah? You plant da dry seed, wheat seed o some odda kine seed. But God, he da One dat make da seed, an he figga wat da plant goin look like wen come up. Every diffren kine seed, wen start fo grow, goin look diffren. Jus cuz you call plenny kine tings “one body,” dat no mean dey all da same kine ting. Da peopo, dey get one kine body. Da animals, dey get one nodda kine. Da birds, one nodda kine. Da fishes, one nodda kine. An get diffren kine tings inside da sky an inside da world. Da tings inside da sky, dey stay awesome, but dey diffren den da tings inside da world. An da tings dat get body hea inside da world, dey all awesome too, but dey diffren den da tings inside da sky. Da sun awesome, but not same kine awesome jalike da moon. An da moon stay awesome, but not jalike da stars, yeah? An da stars, dey awesome too, but diffren kine awesome. An da way one star shine, one nodda star shine diffren, but all stay awesome still yet, yeah? Wen da mahke guys come back alive, same ting goin happen jalike wit da seed, you know. Dey put da guyʼs body inside da groun an he come rotten. But wen da guy come back alive, he no goin mahke eva! Wen dey put da dead body inside da groun, ony ugly. But wen da guy come back alive, he goin be awesome! Wen dey put da body inside da groun, da guy no can do notting. But wen he come back alive, he goin be strong awready! Befo dey put da dead body inside da groun, was one guy dat can ony tink an feel, yeah? But afta he come back alive, goin be Godʼs Spirit dat make da guy live fo real kine! Get peopo dat can ony tink an feel, you know, an get peopo dat get real kine life from Godʼs Spirit. An dey get diffren kine bodies. Dis Wat Kine Body We Goin Get Wen We Come wat da Bible wen say befo time: Da first guy dat was jalike us guys was Adam. He “wen come alive an he wen tink an feel.” But da last Adam kine guy is Christ. He get one spirit inside him dat can make odda peopo come alive fo real kine too. First ting, get da guy dat can ony tink an feel. Den latas, get da guy dat get da real kine life from Godʼs Spirit. Da first guy Adam wen come from da groun. God wen make him from da dust. Da odda guy Christ, he wen come from da sky. An us guys dat come from da dust, we jalike dat odda guy Adam dat God wen make from da dust. But da peopo dat stay tight wit God in da sky, dey stay jalike da Christ guy dat wen come from da sky. Us guys, right now we look jalike da Adam guy dat God wen make from da dust. Bumbye, we goin come jalike da Christ guy dat come from da sky, too. Eh bruddas an sistas! Let me tell you guys someting. Peopo wit blood an bones inside, not nuff fo come Godʼs kids an get him fo dea King! Peopo wit body dat goin come rotten, dey no can handle da good kine stuff dat no goin come rotten eva. So, listen up! I like tell you guys one ting dat was secret befo time! From all us guys, get some guys dat no goin mahke! But all us guys, we all goin come diffren! Dis all goin happen real fast, mo fast den you can blink yoa eye. Goin happen bumbye, wen time fo blow da last trumpet. Goin get da noise from da trumpet. Right den, da mahke guys goin come back alive. No way dey goin mahke an come rotten one mo time! Same ting wit us guys, we all goin come diffren. All dis stuff dat goin come Jerusalem side, an I goin write lettas fo tell rotten, gotta come diffren kine, so bumbye no come rotten one mo time. Dis body dat can mahke now, gotta come diffren kine, so no can mahke eva again! Dat time, wen da body dat can come rotten now, goin come diffren kine, an no goin come rotten eva again! Da body dat can mahke now, goin come diffren kine, an no goin mahke eva again! Dat time, goin happen jalike da Bible wen say befo time: “We no goin mahke no moa, an 55 “Da Devil dat like make us guys mahke, We no goin cry inside, 56 How come he can zap us guys now an we mahke? Cuz we wen do da bad kine stuff, az why. An how come da bad kine stuff we do, get plenny power lidat? Cuz Godʼs Rules show dat da bad kine stuff stay plenny wrong, az why. But now, everyting stay diffren! All us guys like tell God, “Mahalo plenny!” He wen make us guys da winnas ova da bad kine stuff, cuz our Boss Jesus Christ, he da winna fo real kine! So den, bruddas an sistas, my good friends. Stand strong an solid. No let notting shake you guys up.

An God like us guys, cuz we jalike one sweet smell dat make him tink bout Christ.

Wen da peopo dat goin cut demself off from God see us, dat make dem tink bout how dey goin be cut off from God bumbye. Wen da peopo dat goin get life to da max fo real kine see us, dat make dem tink bout how dey goin stay alive fo eva. Let Go Da Guy Dat Wen Do Da Bad Kine Stuff Eh! Who stay big nuff fo handle all dat? No (1 Corinthians 5:1-13) mo nobody, fo shua! Us guys, we not like plenny odda peopo dat ony teach wat God say so dey can make money. No way! Wen us guys talk, everybody can see dat we fo real, an dat da stuff we say come from God, an dat we stay tight wit Christ. Us, Da Helpa Guys Fo Godʼs New Deal 7 1 If you guys tink we starting fo talk big odda guys need, we no need um! We get one letta awready, an dass you guys, you know. Da stuff we know bout you guys, stay inside our heart awready. Everybody know you guys, jalike dey reading one letta. Stay clear dat you guys, you stay jalike one letta dat Christ wen write, an dat he wen give to us guys fo bring ova hea. Christ neva use ink fo write um, he wen use da Spesho Spirit from da God dat stay alive fo real kine. Christ neva write um on top one flat stone da way da Boss Up Dea wen do um fo Moses -- da ting Christ wen write on top, dass someting dass alive, I mean jalike he write um inside da peopoʼs hearts so dey know um. We know we can trus God dat all dis stuff stay true, cuz Christ wen show us. Our own self, we no can say dat we get da power fo do anyting. Da ony power us guys get, come from God. God da One wen make us da kine workas dat can tell peopo bout Godʼs New Deal. Dat New Deal not bout sticking wit some rules, but sticking wit Godʼs Spirit. If you ony stick wit da Rules, jalike you mahke inside, you no get da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. But if you stick wit Godʼs Spirit, you live fo how awesome da Boss stay. Da Spirit from real kine. Da time God wen carve da Rules on top da flat stone, was awesome, you know. (But no matta you do wat dose Rules say, still yet you goin cut yoaself off from God.) Den, afta Moses wen get da Rules, his face wen shine so plenny, was so awesome, dat da Israel peopo no can stay look at um. But den da shine wen go way. So den, wat Godʼs Spirit do inside our hearts stay plenny mo awesome den dat! You know, cuz a da Rules we mahke, but still yet da Rules stay awesome. Godʼs Spirit help us get um right wit God, an dat even mo awesome. Da Rules dat everybody wen tink stay awesome, jalike dey not awesome now, cuz get someting dat stay even mo awesome. You know, da Rule kine stuff stay awesome. Dey awesome jalike Moses face an den da shine wen go way. Still yet, dey stay awesome. But dose tings dat stay foeva, dat kine stuff stay mo awesome still yet. All us guys know fo shua dat Godʼs New Deal goin stay foeva, dass why we no mo shame fo talk strait out. We no need ack jalike Moses. He wen cover up his face so da Israel peopo no can see da shine go way. Da Israel peopo, God wen make um hard head so dey no can tink good. Even right now wen dey read inside da Bible bout da Deal from befo time dat God wen make, jalike dey get cover ova dea head, cuz dey no like listen, an no can undastan. No mo nobody can make um listen an undastan, ony Christ can. Even now still yet, weneva da Jewish peopo read wat Moses wen write, dey listen, but dey no undastan, cuz dey no listen inside dea hearts, jalike dey get cover ova dea hearts. But weneva somebody start fo trus da Boss, Christ help um undastan inside dea hearts. Jalike da Bible wen tell bout Moses, “He take away da ting dat cover his face.” 17 Inside da Bible, wen Moses wen talk bout “Da Boss,” he mean Godʼs Spirit, same ting. Wen we get da Spirit from da Boss Up Dea, we can talk to God any time we like. Az how he change us fo come awesome jalike him, mo an moa. An our faces no stay cover up, an now we can stay tinking plenny bout da Boss Up Dea, dass how he help us. Rich Kine Stuff Inside Cheap Clay Bowls (Da Start 1:3; Songs fo God 116:10) 1 God wen give us guys chance, so he wen give us dis job fo tell peopo bout his New Deal. Dass why we no give up. So dis wat we do: we tell everybody we no goin do da bad kine stuff some odda peopo do. Dey do um wen nobody can see, an dey no mo shame. We no try bulai nobody. We no try teach fake stuff bout wat God say, but we goin teach da true stuff strait out. Den everybody can go check us out demself, an dey can see wat kine guys us in front God. If get peopo dat no undastan da Good Stuff From God dat we teach, dey da peopo dat goin wipe out. Da Devil, he jalike da god fo da peopo nowdays. He wen make some peopo jalike dey blind inside dea heads. Az da peopo dat no trus da Boss who fo real. (Outa Egypt 34:34) Dass jalike dey no can see da light. Dey no can undastan da Good Stuff bout how awesome Christ stay. Christ, he o same like God. He jalike one picha fo show how God stay. Us guys no talk plenny bout ourself. We talk plenny bout Jesus Christ da Boss. We ony say dis bout ourself: us guys come fo kokua you guys, cuz we Jesus guys. God wen say, “From da dark place, I like da light shine,” an he wen make his light shine inside our hearts. God like give us da light. Dat mean, wen we tink bout Christ, we know how awesome God stay. God inside us, no matta we jus regula kine peopo. Dat show dat da big power come from God an not from us guys. Dass jalike wen somebody get rich kine stuff inside cheap clay bowls. We get plenny presha from all ova, but we still can handle. We no can undastan everyting, but we no give up. Get guys dat make us suffa plenny, but God no leave us by ourself. Dey bus us up, but dey no wipe us out. Every place we go, da way us guys suffa an get bus up, show how plenny Jesus wen suffa wen he wen mahke. An cuz our body no mahke no matta we get bus up, dat show dat Jesus still stay alive now. Every day, us guys dat stay alive, we almos mahke cuz we Jesus guys. An dis way everybody can see dat Jesus give us real kine life, no matta our bodies goin mahke bumbye. So den, us guys no scared fo talk fo Christ, no matta we can mahke cuz a dat, so dat you guys can stay live fo real kine. “Cuz I wen trus God, dass why I wen talk.” Us guys tink togedda same ting: Cuz we trus God, dass why we talk. We know dat da God dat wen make our Boss Jesus come back alive from mahke, he goin make us guys come back alive too, cuz we stick wit Jesus. God goin put us guys an you guys dea in front him, wea he stay. God do all dis stuff fo help you guys.

So, from now on, we no tink bout nobody da same way odda peopo tink. No matta befo time we wen tink bout Christ da same way odda peopo tink. Now, we no tink bout Christ dat way no moa. Dass why, whoeva stay tight wit Christ, dey one new guy. Da old tings no stay no moa! Look! Da new tings wen come. All dat stuff come from God. He wen bring us back da same side wit him, cuz a wat Christ wen do. An he tell us fo work so da odda peopo can come back togedda wit him too. Wen Christ wen stay inside dis world, God wen use him fo bring da peopo inside da world back da same side wit God. So, he no make dem take da blame fo da way dey wen mess up. An he wen tell us guys all dat, so we can kokua all da odda peopo fo come back togedda wit him. We da talka guys fo Christ. We tell all da peopo dat God stay begging um fo come back.

God wen do dat fo us guys, so dat we can come right, jalike God stay right, cuz a wat Christ wen do. Cuz us guys stay work togedda wit God, we like give you guys good words: No let all Ezekiel 20:34; 37:27; Isaiah 43:6; 52:11; 2 Samuel da good kine stuff God wen do fo you guys 7:8,14) stay fo notting.

Cuz da peopo dat do da right kine stuff, an da odda peopo dat stay agains Godʼs Rules, dey no goin work togedda. Da good kine peopo an da bad kine peopo no can stay tight wit each odda.

You guys wen come sorry da way God like, an you guys wen stay dat way, an dat make you guys like try hard fo clean out da bad kine stuff, an den nobody can blame you guys fo notting. You guys wen come all huhu at da bad kine stuff Wat Make Paul Stay Good Inside you guys wen do, an wen come all scared, cuz you tinking bumbye you goin do same ting one mo time. You guys really like see me, an stay ready fo do all da right ting, an punish da guy dat wen do da bad kine stuff. Cuz you guys wen do everyting da right way, an now no mo nobody can blame you guys fo notting. Dass why, no matta I wen send you guys dat letta, I neva write um fo da guy ova dea dat wen do da ting dat stay wrong, o fo da wahine he wen do bad to. I wen write um fo kokua you guys wen say fo real kine in front God, an dat you guys get plenny love an aloha fo us guys. All dis make us feel mo betta inside. You guys wen help Titus feel real good inside, so dat his heart stay rest inside. An aloha fo real kine, an go all out, jalike da dat make us guys feel plenny good inside too. I wen tell Titus good tings bout you guys, an now you guys neva make me shame.

An he get even mo love an aloha fo you guys everytime he rememba how you guys wen do wat we wen say, an you guys wen take him in, no matta you guys stay scared an stay shaking. I stay real good inside cuz I can trus you guys, an I no need worry bout notting! My bruddas an sistas, we like you guys know da plenny good tings God wen do fo da church peopo dat come togedda fo him all ova Macedonia. Dey had real hard time an wen suffa plenny, but still yet dey stay real good inside. Dass why, no matta dey no mo notting, dey still yet wen give plenny money wit dea good heart fo da Jerusalem church peopo. I tell you guys dat dey wen like give all dey can, an even moa. An dey wen do um. No was cuz somebody tell um dey gotta. Dey wen beg us plenny fo let um help give money fo kokua da peopo dat stay spesho fo God, Jerusalem side. Dey neva do ony like we wen tink dey goin do -- dey wen do plenny moa! First ting, dey wen give demself to da Boss Up Dea, an dey wen say, “We like give ourself fo do wat you guys like, cuz dass wat God like.” 6 Befo time, Titus wen start tings fo help you guys, so dat you can kokua Godʼs peopo dat get hard time. So we wen tell him fo help you guys some moa, so you guys can pau dis spesho job. You guys stay do good job, how you guys trus God, how you guys talk, da stuff you guys know, how you guys go all out fo do all da tings you guys do, an da plenny love an aloha dat you guys get fo us guys. Az why I like fo you guys do good job fo dis ting too: give plenny to da odda church peopo dat come togedda fo God. I not telling you guys wat fo do, but I like see if you guys get plenny love an Macedonia church guys. You guys know dat our Boss Jesus Christ wen do plenny good tings fo you guys. Befo time he was rich, but he wen come poor fo help you guys, so dat you guys can come rich. Last year you guys wen like start fo help. You guys not ony wen give money, but you guys wen give from yoa heart. Dis wat I tink stay good fo you guys fo do: 11 Give da rest a da money now. I know you guys wen like help out da peopo dat stay spesho fo God Jerusalem side. So do um awready, from wat you guys get. If you guys like kokua, wateva you give, az okay, 8 if you guys give wat you can, not wat you Dey Give Wit Good Kine Heart no can. I no mean dat you guys get all da (Outa Egypt 16:18) presha, an da odda guys no mo presha. We like everybody be same same. Right now you guys get plenny money, an you guys can kokua da odda peopo. Bumbye dey goin get plenny money, an dey goin kokua you guys. Den everybody goin be same same, 15 jalike da Bible wen say befo time, “Da peopo dat wen pick up plenny, Dey neva have mo plenny den dey need. An da peopo dat wen pick up litto bit, Dey neva need mo plenny.” Titus An His Friends (Proverbs 3:4) 16 But I tank God, cuz he wen make Titus like go all out fo help you guys, jalike me. Titus wen like do wat we wen aks him fo do, an he going all out fo go by you guys ova dea. I neva need fo tell him. He wen tink fo go by himself. We goin send one brudda wit Titus. All da church guys talk good bout him, cuz he work hard fo tell peopo da Good Kine Stuff From God. An da church guys wen pick him fo go wit us fo do dis good ting fo da peopo dat need help. We do um fo show how awesome da Boss Up Dea stay, an cuz we really like kokua dem guys ova dea. We tink hard fo do um da right way, so dat nobody can talk any kine bout da way we goin carry all dis money ova dea Jerusalem side. We tink hard how fo do da right ting, not ony in front da Boss, but in front da peopo too. So, our brudda we sending wit da guys dat goin carry da money, we wen check um out plenny times an plenny ways awready, an we know dat he goin go all out fo you guys. An now he going all out even moa, cuz he know you guys goin do da right ting. guys mo plenny stuffs den you need, so dat 23 My brudda Titus everytime stay work wit me fo you guys. An da diffren peopos from all ova da place dat come togedda fo God, dey wen pick dese odda bruddas fo carry da money. Titus an da odda bruddas, dey goin help show da peopo how awesome Christ stay. So, show all dem guys dat goin carry da money how much plenny love an aloha you guys get. An show um why we talk so good bout you guys. Den da church peopo all ova da place goin know fo shua dat you guys get love an aloha fo dem. I no need write you guys fo tell how you goin kokua da peopo dat stay spesho fo God. Cuz I know how you guys really like help um, an I stay telling da Macedonia dat stay spesho fo God, dat goin kokua dem church peopo how plenny you guys like kokua dem. I wen tell um dat from last year peopo tell God “Mahalo plenny!” 13 Wen you guys from Akaia side was ready fo give money, an da way you guys was ready fo go all out, wen make da odda peopo like give money too. But I goin send da bruddas fo show dat all da good stuff we wen say bout you guys stay fo real, an dat you guys From Christ, cuz you guys do wat you say. goin be ready, jalike I wen say. You know, Wen all you guys give wit good kine heart if some Macedonia guys come wit me an find you guys not ready wit da money, we goin get plenny shame, cuz we wen trus you guys plenny. An you guys goin get plenny shame too, you know. Dass why I wen tink, good if da bruddas go ova dea first, an make everyting ready, so you guys to God fo Jesus! He da awesome Gif God can give da money da way you wen say you goin give. Dat goin be someting you guys like give from da heart, not someting you no like give. But I tell you guys dis: “Da guy who plant litto bit seed, he goin get one small crop. Da guy dat plant plenny seed wit good heart, he goin get mo plenny crop, an tink I shame fo talk strait out wen I stay he goin stay good inside.” 7 Let every guy wit you guys, but I no mo shame fo talk give how plenny money he wen tink fo give strait out wen I stay one far place? Eh, I inside his heart. He no can have bad kine feeling wen he give um. Nobody suppose to make um give. Cuz God get plenny love an aloha fo da guy dat give from his heart an feel good inside. God can give you everytime you guys goin need someting, you guys goin get mo den nuff tings fo do every good ting. Da Bible wen say befo time, “God give stuffs to da poor peopo Wit good kine heart. He everytime do da right ting, An he stay lidat foeva.” 10 God give seed to da farma guys who plant. God give us bread fo eat. Dat same God goin help you guys do da right ting mo an moa, jalike you was farma guys an he goin give you guys mo an mo seed 9 fo plant. God goin give you guys mo choke tings den you guys goin need, so you Kokua Da Bruddas An Sistas guys can everytime kokua peopo wit good (Proverbs 11:24; 22:9; Songs fo God 112:9)kine heart. Den wen we give Godʼs peopo Jerusalem side da money from you guys, dey goin tell God “Mahalo plenny.” 12 Da help you guys goin give da peopo ova dea plenny, an same time goin make plenny you guys kokua da peopo, dat goin show proof dat you guys fo real. Den peopo goin talk plenny good kine bout God, cuz dey goin see dat you guys really mean um wen you guys say you trus da Good Stuff fo dem an fo all da odda peopo, den dey goin talk plenny good kine bout God too. Da Christian peopo Jerusalem side goin pray fo you guys, an dey goin like see you guys mo an moa, cuz God do choke plenny good tings fo you guys. “Mahalo plenny” wen give us, dat stay worth mo plenny den anyting. Paul Talk Bout Wat He Do Fo God (Jeremiah 9:24) 1 Dis yoa brudda Paul talking. You guys telling you guys fo listen to me, cuz Christ get good heart fo you guys, an he give you guys chance. Get guys ova dea dat say dat us guys stay ack jalike da odda peopo inside dis world ack. So wen I come ova dea, I tink I gotta talk strait to dem guys. I now, an we stay waiting an trus dat we goin telling you guys fo try listen to wat I saying help you guys mo an moa, jalike God wen now, so den wen I come ova dea, I no need talk strong to dem guys. Wen we get beef wit odda peopo, we no fight like da peopo inside da world dat donno God, no matta we live inside da world too. We no use da same kine tings fo beef, jalike da peopo inside dis world use. Wen we beef agains da hard head kine peopo dat try fo make argue, we get Godʼs power fo show dat dea hard head tinking all hamajang. Everyting dey do fo make demself mo importan, an fo stand agains anybody dat like know God, we goin teach um fo tink diffren kine, da way Christ like us tink. Afta you guys start fo do everyting Christ say, we goin stay ready fo handle anybody dat still yet do wat Christ say no do. You guys ony like look at da tings on da outside. If one guy tink he Christʼs guy, he gotta tink bout dis, dat we Christʼs guys too, jalike him. I no mo shame fo tell everybody dat da Boss wen give us guys da right fo make you guys strong inside, an no wipe you guys out. I no like make like I try fo scare you guys wit da lettas I write. Some guys say, “Da lettas from dis Paul guy, dey talk strong an dey get plenny power, but wen he stay ova hea, he no ack lidat, an wat he say, good fo notting.” 11 Try let dem guys figga dis: Da lettas we write wen we no stay dea, an how we ack wen we come dea, same ting. Get peopo dat tell everybody dat dey real good peopo. We no make ourself jalike dem. We no like say we jalike dem. Dose guys, dey ony look at odda guys jalike demself, an dey figga dey stay good jalike dem. Wen dey make lidat, dey no undas- tan notting. We no goin talk big bout someting we neva do. We ony goin talk big bout da job God wen give us fo do. Wat we wen do fo you guys, God wen tell us fo do dat. We no stay ova-do um wen we talk big bout you guys. Cuz we da guys wen come an tell you guys da Good Stuff From Christ, an you guys wen listen. If God neva send us by you guys, an we still yet wen talk big bout you guys, den dass not right. We no talk big bout da stuff odda peopo wen do. You guys stay trus God mo an mo tell us fo do. Den we can tell da Good Stuff From Christ inside da places da odda side a you guys, wea nobody stay working. No good we talk big bout wat odda guys wen do inside dea kuleana like we was da guys wen do um. You know, da Bible say, “Da guy who talk big, let um talk big bout God da Boss.” 18 Anybody talk good bout demself, dat no goin make da Boss say, “Dis guy okay.” So den, who okay? Da guy da Boss talk good bout, he okay. Paul An Da Fake Talka Guys 1 Eh, I like you guys try take wat I say, no matta if I talk litto bit lolo kine. Try listen! Jalike God stay jealous fo you guys, I stay jealous fo you guys too. I wen promise Christ dat he can take you guys in, an you guys not pilau inside, jalike one husban take da wahine dat neva sleep wit nobody yet. Now you guys like stick wit Christ fo real kine an stay clean inside yoa heart jalike him. But I stay scared dat you guys goin like go way from Christ, an tink diffren kine, jalike Eve wen go way befo time. Da snake wen bulai her, you know, cuz he one sly bugga! Everytime somebody show up by you guys an teach you guys bout one diffren kine Jesus, an not da same Jesus we wen tell you guys bout, how come you guys trus dat guy? You guys wen let Godʼs Good an Spesho Spirit take ova you befo, so how come you guys wen take in one diffren kine spirit now? You wen go trus da Good Stuff From Christ befo, so how come you guys wen go trus one diffren kine teaching now? I no tink I no good. No matta dem odda guys say God wen send um, an dey get big head, dey not mo betta den me. No matta I no can talk fancy kine, but I know plenny tings, an everytime I wen show you guys everyting an every way. I neva aks you guys fo pay me wen I wen teach you guys da Good Stuff From God. I wen make myself notting so I can make you guys look good. You guys tink dass was wrong fo me fo do? Da peopo from odda churches inside da odda places wen give money fo kokua me fo help you guys. Dass jalike I take from dem guys so I can help you guys. Wen I wen stay wit you guys an I wen need someting, I neva bodda you guys fo aks fo notting. Da Macedonia bruddas wen come an kokua me. But everytime I neva bodda you guys notting, an I no goin bodda you guys eva. Wat Christ say stay true, an I know fo shua wat I say stay true too, cuz I stay tight wit Christ. An nobody ova dea Akaia side can shut me up fo talking big bout all dat stuff. How come I say dat? You guys tink I no mo love an aloha fo you guys? God know I get plenny love an aloha fo you guys. I goin still yet do all da stuff I doing, so dat da peopo who say dey same same jalike us guys, an talk big bout being same same like us, no goin get notting fo say. Dem guys say dat God wen send um, but dey all bulai. Dey trick da peopo. Dey try make demself look like talkas fo Christ, jalike dey his guys, but dey still fake. Dat no blow our minds, cuz da Devil, he go try ack jalike he one good angel messenja guy fo God. Dass no big ting if da Devilʼs worka guys go try ack jalike dey working fo da good an right stuffs too. Dat no blow our minds. Bumbye God goin pay dem back fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do. I goin say dis one mo time: No let nobody tink I ack jalike one lolo head. But if you guys tink I one lolo head, den take me in jalike one lolo head. Den I can talk big litto bit too. Wat I telling you guys now, I sound jalike one lolo head talking, but da Boss Up Dea neva tell me fo say dat. Get plenny guys talking big jalike da peopo inside da world talk big, so I goin talk big too. You guys like make friends wit da lolo head guys. Gotta be okay, cuz you guys stay akamai plenny, aah? You guys let da odda guys go wen dey make any kine to you. Dey make you guys jalike dea slaves. Dey rip you guys off. Dey scam you guys. Dey ack jalike you guys notting, an dey importan. Dey slap yoa head. An still yet you guys let um ack lidat. Oh, auwe! I stay shame fo say we neva was strong nuff fo make any kine lidat to you guys too, jalike dem. Watevas da odda guys talk big bout, I goin talk big lidat too. I talking jalike one lolo head, you know. Dem guys Hebrew guys? Yeah, yeah, me too. Dem guys Israel guys? Yeah, yeah, me too. Dem guys come from Abraham? Yeah, yeah, me too. Dem guys work fo Christ? Yeah, yeah, me too. I work mo hard mo plenny. I wen stay inside jail mo plenny. Da odda guys wen whip me mo hard. An plenny times I almos wen mahke. Eh, five times da Jewish guys wen whip me thirty-nine times. Three times dey wen beat me wit hard sticks. One time dey wen throw big kine stones fo kill me. Three times I wen stay inside one bus up boat, an one nite an one day I wen stay inside da deep ocean. Everytime I go all ova da place. Plenny tings wen almos kill me: da big rivers, da robber guys, my peopo da Jewish guys, da guys dat not Jews, da ocean, da guys dat say dey our bruddas but dey not. All dat stuff wen almos kill me. I almos wen mahke inside da town an outside in da boonies. I get hard time, an I wen work hard. Plenny times I no can sleep nite time. I get hungry an thirsty, an had plenny times I no mo notting fo eat. I neva have clotheses, an I wen stay real cold. An dis too: every day I feel da presha fo tink hard bout all da bruddas an sistas Paul Suffa Wen He Tell Peopo Bout God dat come togedda fo God all ova da place. If get somebody dat feel jalike he no can handle, den I feel da same ting too. If get somebody dat do da bad kine ting, den I feel sore inside cuz a dat. If I gotta talk big, den I goin talk big bout da stuff dat show I no can handle. Jesus, he da Boss, an God, he Jesus Fadda. God, he know I no bulai. Everytime we tell everybody dat God stay good, foeva. You know, wen I wen stay inside Damascus, da governa unda King Aretas, he wen put police guys all ova da place fo bus me. I wen go inside one big basket, an my friends wen put me down wit one rope, from one window inside da big wall, fo go outside town. An I wen run away from da governa. Dat time, I no can handle fo shua! I gotta talk big, no matta talking big goin poho. I goin tell bout da stuff I wen see dass jalike one dream, an wat da Boss wen show me. I know one guy dat stay tight wit Christ. Fourteen years ago somebody wen bring him up inside da mos high part a da sky. I donno if he wen stay inside his body o outside his body, but God know. I know dat guy, no matta he inside o outside his body, 4 somebody wen take him up dea inside Godʼs Beautiful Place. He wen hear stuff dass too awesome fo talk bout, stuff dat nobody can talk bout. I goin talk big bout dat kine guy, but I no goin talk big bout me. Ony da kine stuff I no can handle, I goin talk big bout dat. Even wen I like talk big, dat not stupid you know, cuz I ony tell da trut. But I no goin talk big, so dat nobody goin tink I mo betta den how dey see me ack o hear wat I say, 7 o hear all da awesome stuff God wen show me. But so dat I no get big head, I get one ting dat stay jalike one messenja from da Devil, jalike one sharp thorn inside my body. Dat ting make me suffa plenny. Three times awready I wen beg God da Boss fo take dis ting away from me. But he wen tell me, “I do plenny good tings fo you, an dass all you need. My power mo strong inside you wen you no can handle trouble yoa own self.” Dass why I goin talk big even moa, cuz get plenny stuff I no can handle. Dass how Christʼs power goin stay wit me. So den, no bodda me. I still feel good inside, wen I no can handle, an wen dey try make me shame, an wen I get hard time, an wen dey make me suffa, an wen I get plenny presha. All dis cuz I Christʼs guy. Wen I no can handle, den I get da power fo come mo strong an den I can handle, cuz a him. Corint 11 You guys wen ack jalike God neva send me. Dass why I wen talk jalike one lolo head guy. But den, mo betta you guys talk good bout me. No matta I notting, dese unreal guys dat say God wen send dem, dey not mo betta den me. Everytime God send one guy fo tell peopo bout him, da guy do awesome an unreal stuff wit power, fo 12 show proof God wen send um. Kay den, Paul See Someting Jalike One Dream I wen do all dat wen I wen stay wit you guys, an I wen hang in dea fo you guys. Ony one ting I neva let you guys do dat da church guys from odda places wen do: I neva bodda you guys fo let you kokua me. So no stay mad at me if dass wrong. Eh, dis da numba three time I stay ready fo go by you guys. I no need you guys fo kokua me. I no like da stuffs you guys get, but I ony like you guys.

So I no need you guys stash stuffs fo me, cuz you guys jalike my kids! An you know, I like give wateva I can fo you guys, an I like give myself so you guys can live too. If I get plenny love an aloha fo you guys, dat mean you goin get ony litto bit love an aloha fo me, o wat? But you guys know dis: I neva bodda you guys wit notting. But den you guys wen tink, I one sly bugga, an wen bulai you guys! You tink I wen send da odda guys fo rip you guys off, o wat?

Me an Titus, we do da same kine tings cuz we tink da same way, you know. Eh, you guys was tinking long time we ony talking fo ourself, yeah? Everyting us guys say, God know, cuz we no can hide notting from him, an we stay tight wit Christ. We get plenny love an aloha fo you guys. Az why everyting we stay doing, we do um fo make you guys mo strong inside. I scared dat wen I come ova dea, maybe I goin see dat you guys no stay how I like. I scared you guys stay squawk at each odda, you guys stay jealous, you guys stay huhu, Paul Tink Bout Da Bruddas An Sistas Inside you guys ony tink bout yoa own self, you guys talk any kine bout each odda, you guys talk stink bout da odda guy, you guys get big head, an everyting goin be all jam up. An maybe you guys goin see dat I no stay how you guys like. I scared dat wen I come ova dea, God goin make me get plenny shame in front you guys, an I goin make plenny peopo stay real sad inside, cuz get plenny guys dat wen do da bad kine stuff befo, an still yet dey not sorry, an dey neva like change demself notting. Dey stay pilau inside. Dey fool aroun. Dey like make any kine to anybody an no mo shame. Dis da numba three time I going ova dea fo see you guys. Da Bible say, “If one guy goin poin finga one nodda guy, gotta get one o two odda guys poining finga too fo da same ting, o no mean notting.” 2 Wen I wen stay wit you guys da numba two time, I awready wen tell you guys, an now I telling you one mo time: Wen I come ova dea I not goin let go da guys dat wen do da bad kine stuff befo. Dass fo any odda guys dat stay doing bad kine stuff too, you know. Plus, you guys like me show proof dat Christ stay talking wen I stay talking. Christ no stay jalike he no mo power wen he do tings fo you guys, but he get plenny power. Christ neva have power wen dey wen kill him on top da cross. An us guys neva have power jalike Christ get power. But God wen give Christ da power fo live now, an he wen give us da power fo live too wit Christ an work fo you guys. Look inside yoaself fo find out if fo real kine you guys trus Christ. Check yoaself out real good. You guys neva know dat Jesus Christ stay tight wit you guys, o wat? If he no stay tight wit you guys, den you not his guys. I trus you guys goin check us out real good, an goin see dat we stay fo real fo Christ. Now I stay aks our Fadda dat you guys no goin do notting wrong. Us guys no worry bout wat odda peopo tink, if dey tink we doing okay o not. But we like you guys do wat stay right, no matta we look like we not fo real -- no bodda us. We no can do notting dat stay going agains da true stuff, but we can do ony wat stay fo da true stuff. Wen you guys get power, an us guys no mo power, we feel plenny good inside. Wat we aks God fo do, is fo help you guys come mo an mo betta everytime. Dass why I write dis stuff wen I no stay ova dea wit you guys, so dat wen I come ova dea, I no need hwcGAL 1:1-2 1-2 Dis me, Paul. I one messenja fo God da Fadda an Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. I stay write dis letta fo all you church peopo inside Galatia. Jesus Christ an God da Fadda, who wen make Jesus come back alive from mahke, dey wen tell me fo go all ova fo tell peopo da Good Stuff Bout Jesus. No was peopo dat wen tell me fo go, o give me da right fo do um, was God. All da odda bruddas an sistas ova hea wit me, dey give you guys dea aloha too. I like God our Fadda an da Boss Jesus Christ do plenny good tings fo you guys, an make you guys hearts rest inside. Christ wen give himself fo mahke fo throw out da bad kine stuff us guys wen do. He wen do dat cuz God our Fadda like him take us outa da bad kine stuff da peopo nowdays stay doing. I like everybody tell how awesome God stay, foeva. Dass it! You guys blow my mind! Quick time you guys pau trus God an go trus odda kine stuff. God wen pick you guys cuz he like Christ fo do plenny good kine stuff fo you guys. But you guys go trus odda kine stuff awready. Da kine odda stuff dey teach, dass not da Good Kine Stuff Bout Christ. Dem guys like change da Good Kine Stuff Bout Christ. Dey ony stay jam up you guys. Listen! Even if us guys o one angel guy from da sky tell you guys odda kine stuff, diffren from da Good Kine Stuff From God dat we wen teach you guys befo, God goin punish um foeva. Jalike we wen tell you guys befo, I goin say um one mo time: Whoeva teach you guys diffren kine stuff den da Good Kine Stuff From God dat you guys wen take from us, God goin punish um foeva. You guys tink I trying fo say wat da peopo like, o wat God like? O you guys tink I trying fo make me look good? No way! If I wen try do wat da peopo like an make Jerusalem one mo time wit Barnabas. An me look good, den I no can be one worka fo I wen take Titus wit me too. I wen go Christ. talk heavy an give you guys hard time. God wen tell me fo make you guys strong inside, not fo wipe you guys out. Aloha no, bruddas an sistas. Do every- ting right. Listen to wat I say. Tink da same way wit each odda. Be good to each odda. God get plenny love an aloha fo you guys. He goin stay wit you guys all da time an Watch Out Wat You Guys Stay Doing help you guys stay good wit each odda. Give each odda one hug an kiss wit love (Da Rules Second Time 19:15) an aloha. All da peopo dat stay spesho fo God ova hea tell you guys “Aloha.” 14 I like da Boss Jesus Christ do plenny good tings fo you guys. I like God show you guys his love an aloha. An I like Godʼs Spesho Spirit come tight wit all you guys. hwcGAL 2:2 How God Wen Send Paul All Ova Eh, bruddas an sistas, I like you guys 11 Da Letta From Paul know dis: da Good Stuff From God dat I wen Fo Da Galatia Peopo tell you guys, dass not someting da peopo wen make up. I neva get um from peopo, an nobody wen teach um to me. Jesus, da “Aloha!” Spesho Guy God Wen Send, he wen show um to me. You guys wen hear bout da way I wen make befo, wen I wen do everyting da Jewish Rules say we gotta do. I wen make Godʼs church peopo suffa plenny, an even waste um, cuz dey believe dat Jesus, he da Spesho Guy God Wen Send, an dat time I neva believe dat. I wen stick wit da Jewish Rules plenny, mo den da odda Jewish guys my age. I wen go all out fo do everyting our ancesta guys wen tell us fo do. But God wen pick me even befo I wen born. Latas he tell me fo come by him, cuz he like do someting spesho fo me. God wen like show me who his Boy fo real kine, so I can teach da peopo dat not Jews da Good Stuff Bout Jesus. Right den an dea I neva talk to nobody, 17 an I neva go Jerusalem fo check out dis stuff wit da guys Da Ony Good Stuff dat God wen pick befo me fo send um all ova, but I go Arabia side, an den I go back Damascus town. Three years lata I wen go Jerusalem fo talk story wit Peter, an I stay ova dea his place fifteen days. Dat time I neva see da odda guys God wen send all ova, ony James, da Boss Jesus brudda. Listen. In front God I say dis: all da stuff I stay write you guys stay true. I no bulai. Den I wen go Syria an Cilicia side. Da church peopo Judea side, dey neva know wat I look like. Dey ony wen hear, “Da guy dat wen make us suffa befo, now he telling everybody fo trus da Good Stuff From God, da same Good Stuff he wen try wipe out befo.” 24 An da church peopo Judea side stay tell everybody how awesome God stay, cuz a me. Paul an da Odda Guys God Send All Ova 1 Den fourteen years lata I wen go Jerusalem cuz God wen tell me fo go. I tell da church guys ova dea da Good Kine Stuff From God dat I stay telling all da diffren peopos dat not Jews. But da church guys ova dea dat look like dey da leadas, I ony wen talk to dem guys by demself, so dey can check um out. I no like teach da wrong kine stuff, cuz den all my hard work no goin count. Titus stay wit me. He not one Jew, he one Greek guy. But no matta, dey neva make him cut skin fo come one Jew. Had some odda guys ova dea dat make like dey our bruddas, but dey not. Dem guys wen make like dey Godʼs peopo so dey can find out how we ack now dat Jesus Christ wen let us go cuz we stay tight wit him, so we no gotta do wat da Rules say fo get um right wit God. Dey do dat cuz dey like make us so we gotta stick wit da Rules again. But we neva let dem get dea way, not even litto bit, cuz we like da Good An True Stuff Bout Christ stay good fo you guys. But da guys dat look like dey leadas, dey no big ting to me, cuz God no take peopo in cuz a how dey look. Dem guys neva have notting fo make wat I teach mo betta. But dem guys find out dat God wen trus me fo tell da Good Stuff Bout Him to da peopo who not Jews, jalike Peter tell um to da Jews. Cuz jalike God wen work inside Peter, fo send him fo tell da Jews his Good Stuff, he wen work inside me, fo send me by da peopo dat not Jews. James, Peter, an John, dey da guys dat look like dey importan, da leadas fo da church peopo. Wen dey wen know dat God wen do plenny good stuff fo me, dey wen shake hands wit me an Barnabas, fo show dat we stay togedda. An we all wen say da same ting: dey goin go by da Jews, an we goin go by da peopo dat not Jews. Ony one ting dey like us guys fo do: no foget fo kokua da poor peopo. You know, I awready go all out fo do um. But wen Peter wen come to Antiok, I wen stand up agains him, cuz he wen do wrong. Cuz befo da guys wen come dat work wit James, Peter wen eat wit da bruddas dat not Jews. But afta James guys come, he wen go back, an no eat wit da guys dat not Jews, cuz he scared da guys dat say dat all Jesus guys gotta stick wit da Jewish Rules, cut skin, an come Jews. An da odda Jewish bruddas wen make like Peter, cuz dey say one ting an do anodda. Dey say Christ wen let um go, but den dey start fo stick wit da Jewish Rules again. An even Barnabas wen get suck in, an do da same ting, jalike dem. But wen I see dat dem guys ack lidat, an no do wat Godʼs Good An True Stuff From God say, I tell Peter in front all dem guys, “You one Jew. God wen tell us we no gotta stick wit da Jewish Rules no moa fo get um right wit him. So you no ack like one Jew no moa, but like one guy dat not Jew. Den how come you like make da peopo dat not Jews ack like dey Jews?” Da Jews An Da Odda Peopos All Gotta Trus Jesus 15 Us guys wen born Jews. We not like da odda peopos dat donno God an do bad kine stuff. We know dat nobody can get um right wit God jus cuz he do wat da Rules say, but he get um right wit God cuz he trus Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus Christ. Us guys trus Jesus Christ, so God say we get um right wit him. We no go do wat da Rules say so dat we can get um right wit God, cuz da Rules no make nobody get um right wit God. Us guys stay trying fo stay tight wit Christ, fo get um right wit God. But if we still yet stay do bad kine stuff, you tink dat mean Christ stay make us do bad kine stuff? No way! Cuz if I go trus da Rules fo make me get um right wit God, afta I wen teach dat da Rules no can make us get um right wit him, dat show dat I stay broke da Rules. I wen try do wat da Rules say, but no can, cuz da Rules no mo power fo help me do um. Dass how come I no stick wit da Rules no mo fo get um right wit God, but I stay learning fo live fo God. Jalike I wen mahke wit Christ on top da cross. Now dass Paul Scold Peter not me dat stay live no moa, but Christ stay live inside me. I get da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva inside my body now, cuz I stay trus Godʼs Boy. He get plenny love an aloha fo me, an he wen give himself fo mahke fo me. I no goin make no good, all da good tings God wen do fo us. If we can get um right wit God cuz we do wat da Rules say, den Christ wen mahke fo notting.:26; 21:23; Habakkuk 2:4; Da Prieses 18:5) 1 You guys from Galatia, yoa head all jam up! Befo time we wen tell you guys strait out da Good Stuff bout how odda guys wen kill Jesus Christ on top da cross an he wen mahke fo us. But now you guys no listen to da true stuff. Somebody wen put kahuna on top you guys, o wat? Ony one ting I like you guys tell me: How you guys wen get Godʼs Spirit? Cuz you guys wen do wat da Rules say? O cuz you guys wen trus da Good Stuff From God dat you guys wen hear? Fo shua, cuz you guys wen trus da Good Stuff From God! You guys not tinking, o wat? You guys wen trus Godʼs Spirit in da beginning. But now in da end you guys goin try fo do everyting wit yoa own power? All da stuff dat wen happen to you guys -- fo notting? O good fo someting? God stay give you guys his Spirit, an he do awesome stuff fo you guys wit his power. You tink he do um cuz you guys do wat da Rules say, o cuz you guys trus da stuff you guys wen hear? Jalike Abraham. He wen trus God. Az why God wen say Abraham get um right wit him. So den, you guys gotta undastan dis: Da peopo dat trus God, dey jalike Abrahamʼs kids. God wen show inside da Bible dat he goin make all da diffren peopos get um right wit him, cuz dey trus God. So God wen tell Abraham da Good Stuff From God way befo time. He say: “Cuz a you, I goin do plenny good stuffs fo all da diffren peopos all ova da world.” 9 So den, God goin do plenny good stuffs fo da peopo who trus him, jalike he wen do fo Abraham, da guy who wen trus him. Whoeva try do everyting da Rules say fo get um right wit God, dey get one kahuna on top dem. Cuz da Bible say, “Everybody who no stay do everyting dat Godʼs Rules say we gotta do, dey get one kahuna on top dem.” 11 Stay clear dat no mo nobody dat do everyting da Rules say. Dass why nobody get um right wit God da way God see um. Cuz God wen say inside da Bible, “Da guy dat get um right wit me cuz he trus me, he da one dat goin live fo real kine.” 3 12 You know, if you jus do wat da Rules say, dat no mean you trussing God. God wen Do Wat Da Rules Say, O Trus God? say inside da Bible, “Whoeva do everyting (Da Start 15:6; 12:3; Da Rules Second Time da Rules say, dey goin live cuz dey stay do um.” But us guys, we no mo da power fo do everyting da Rules say. Christ, he wen pay da price fo cut us guys loose, so we no gotta do everyting da Rules say fo get um right wit God. Dass why now, we no goin get kahuna on top us. Christ wen get our kahuna on top him, cuz da Bible wen say, “Everybody dat dey kill an hang on top one post, dey get kahuna on top dem.” 14 Christ wen mahke fo pay da price fo us guys, so dat all da diffren peopos all ova da world can get da good stuff God wen promise Abraham, an so us guys who stay tight wit Jesus can get Godʼs Spirit, jalike God wen promise. Da Rules an Wat God Wen Promise (Da Start 12:7; 13:15; 17:7; 24:7) 15 Eh, bruddas, I goin talk bout someting dat everybody can undastan. If one guy make one will an sign um in front odda peopo, den nobody can change um o make um no good. So, God wen promise da good stuffs to Abraham an his boy. He neva say, “an fo yoa boys,” cuz dass plenny peopo. He ony say, “an fo yoa boy,” cuz dass ony one guy, Christ. Dis wat I mean. God wen make da deal wit Abraham long time befo, bout Christ. Den, four hundred an thirty years afta dat, God wen give Moses da Rules. But da Rules no mo power fo make Godʼs promise no good. If Godʼs kids can get dea share cuz dey work fo um wen dey do wat Godʼs Rules say, den no need God fo promise um dea share jalike one gif. Cuz nobody work fo one gif. But God wen give um to Abraham jalike one gif, jalike he wen promise. How come get da Rules, den? God wen give um cuz everybody do bad kine stuff. Wen Godʼs Boy wen come, da One da promise talk bout, den fo get um right wit God, no need da Rules no moa. Angel messenja guys wen give Moses da Rules, an den Moses wen give um to da peopo. So Moses wen stay in da middle, fo talk to both God an da peopo. Need one guy in da middle fo talk to both guys, but no need um if get ony one guy. God stay ony one God, get um right wit God. But God wen send an he wen fix up everyting by himself. You tink Godʼs Rules stay working agains Godʼs promises? No way! If had rules dat get da power fo make peopo live put his own Boyʼs Spirit inside our hearts, foeva, den God wen make peopo get um so now we can tell God, “Papa, you my right wit him wit dem rules. But neva had Fadda!” 7 Dass why you guys not jalike dat kine rules. Da Bible wen say dat slaves no moa dat gotta do wat da Rules say. everybody stay do da bad kine stuff, an dey Now you guys Godʼs kids! An God goin give no can pau do um. An dass how come da you guys everyting he goin give his kids. Bible wen say dat, fo show dat peopo gotta go trus Jesus Christ, fo get da kine life God wen promise. But befo da time fo trus Christ wen come, we gotta do wat da Rules say, no time you guys gotta do everyting da odda matta we no mo power fo do um. Dass how spirits say, no matta dey not real kine gods. wen stay till da time wen come fo God show 9 But now, you guys know God. Mo betta, us how fo trus him. Da Rules jalike one God know you guys. So how come you guys babysitter fo bring us to Christ, so dat we go back an like stick wit da spirits dat stay can trus him an get um right wit God. But junk an not strong? Dey like make you now we can trus Christ, so no need one guys jalike dea slaves one mo time. How babysitter. All you guys Godʼs kids, cuz you wen suppose to do fo da spesho religious days, trus Jesus, Godʼs Spesho Guy. All you an weeks, an months, an years? I scared guys who wen get baptize fo stay tight wit fo you guys, dat I wen work hard fo you Christ an be his guys, now you goin come guys fo notting. I ony wase time. like him. Now, no matta Jew o not Jew, slave o not slave, guy o wahine, you guys fo come jalike me, an no stick wit da Rules all da same cuz you stay tight wit Christ. fo try get um right wit God. I like you guys 29 You guys Christʼs guys, so den you guys Abrahamʼs kids. An you guys goin get yoa guys. Dat time I was wit you guys, you share, jalike God wen promise all his kids. guys neva do notting fo hurt me. You 1 Dis wat I mean. Da fadda like give his Stuff From God da first time. No matta boy everyting da fadda get wen he mahke, my sick wen give you guys hard time, you but da boy no can get um right den an dea guys neva hate me o throw me out. But you if he still yet one small kid. Jalike da slave guys wen take me in jalike I one angel guy guy no own his bossʼs stuffs, da kid still yet from God, o jalike I Jesus, Godʼs Spesho Guy. no own his faddaʼs stuffs, no matta he goin 15 Wat wen happen to you guys? Dat time get um lata on. Da boy get peopo his fadda you guys wen stay so good inside bout me, wen pick fo take care him an his stuffs. He I like tell everybody dat you guys wen even gotta do wat dey tell um till da time come like pull out yoa own eyes an give um to me, dat his fadda wen pick. Same ting wit us if can. You guys tink I hate you, cuz I tell guys. Befo Jesus Christ wen come we jalike you guys da trut, o wat? small kids. We gotta do wat da main spirits dat stay in charge a da world wen tell us. you guys, cuz dey like cut you guys off from 4 But wen da right time wen come, God wen us, so dat you guys goin go all out fo dem. send his Boy. One wahine wen born him, But dass not good. Now, good if dey go all an he gotta do wat da Rules say. Befo out everytime, if dey do good kine stuff, no time we gotta do everyting da Rules say fo matta I stay wit you guys o I no stay. You his Boy Christ so he can mahke fo pay da price fo let us go, so we no gotta stick wit da Da Rules Teach Us Bout da Bad Kine Stuff Rules, an so he can make us jalike his hanai kids. So den, cuz you guys his kids, God wen Paul Tink Plenny Bout da Galatia Bruddas an Sistas 8 Befo time you guys neva know God. Dat come you guys try do everyting dey say you 12 Eh, bruddas an sistas, I beg you guys come jalike me, cuz I wen come jalike you guys wen know I was real sick. Dass why I 4 wen get da chance fo tell you guys da Good 17 But dem buggas, dey go all out fo get guys jalike my kids. Jalike wen one wahine born one baby, I suffa fo you guys again, till you guys come jalike Christ inside yoa hearts. I like come ova dea wit you guys now, an talk diffren kine. But right now I not shua bout you guys. Eh, you guys dat like stick wit da Rules fo get um right wit God, how come you guys no listen to wat da Rules say? Da Bible tell dat Abraham had two boys, one boy from da slave wahine Hagar an da odda boy from his own wife Sarah dat not one slave. Da boy from da slave wahine Hagar, he wen born cuz Abraham wen like get one boy. But da boy from da wife Sarah who not one slave, he wen born cuz God wen promise um. Da two wahines jalike one picha. Dey show da two diffren kine deals dat God wen make wit his peopo. Hagar, da slave wahine, she wen born one slave boy. Now, Hagar, she jalike one picha fo show da deal God wen make wit Moses on top Mount Sinai, wen God wen give Moses da Rules ova dea befo time. Da wahine Hagar, she jalike Mount Sinai, Arabia side, da Rules place. Dass jalike Jerusalem stay nowdays, cuz da Jerusalem peopo all jalike slaves. Jalike slaves gotta do wat somebody tell um, da Jerusalem peopo gotta do wat da Rules say. But get anodda Jerusalem inside da sky, dat come from God fo da peopo dat not slaves. Dass jalike our mudda Sarah, who not one slave. You know, da Bible say, “Da wahine who no can born kids, Da wahine who neva suffa from born kids, Cuz da wahine, her husban wen dump her, 28 Eh, bruddas an sistas, you guys all Godʼs kids too, jalike Isaac, Sarahʼs boy, cuz you guys, God goin punish him, no matta God wen promise Abraham dat he goin get da boy Isaac an plenny mo kids too. Dat time da boy who wen born cuz da fadda Abraham like, wen make any kine to da boy Isaac who wen born cuz Godʼs Spirit like. Same ting today. Wat da Bible say? “Throw out da slave wahine an her boy, cuz her boy no goin get da good stuff da fadda like give his wifeʼs boy.” 31 So den, bruddas an sistas, we not da slave wahineʼs kids, we da kids from da wife dat not slave. We no gotta stick wit da Rules fo get um right wit Da Story Bout Hagar an Sarah God. (Da Start 16:1-16; 21:1-21; Isaiah 54:1) 5 Christ Wen Let Us Go 1 Christ wen let us go, so we no gotta do wat da Rules say fo get um right wit God. So den, hang in dea an be strong. No let dem buggas pile up all kine rules on top you guys again. Listen! Dis me Paul, talking to you guys. If you guys let dem cut skin an make you guys come Jews, cuz dey tell you guys dat you can get um right wit God lidat, den Christ no goin help you guys, notting. Now I goin tell everybody one mo time: Whoeva cut skin so dey get um right wit God, dey gotta do everyting da Rules say fo come good. You guys dat like do wat da Rules say fo try get um right wit God, you guys wen split from Christ, an make yoaself so you no can get all da good stuff he like do fo you guys. Us guys, not like you guys. We trus God, dass why we wait fo him fo make us get um right wit him, cuz we know dat Godʼs Spirit goin help us. Wen we stay tight wit Jesus Christ, no matta cut skin o no cut skin, main ting, we gotta trus God, an show plenny love an aloha fo God an da peopo. You guys was doing real good. Who wen mess you guys up so you no listen to da trut? Dat kine stuff you guys listen She can stay good inside. to now, dat no come from da Boss, who wen tell you guys fo come by him an be his She can bus out an make big noise. guys. Dat kine stuff dey teach, dat start small an den come big an mess up you guys, She get mo plenny kids jalike litto bit yeast inside da bread dough den da wahine who still yet get hus- make da whole bread come big. Cuz I trus ban.” da Boss, I shua dat you guys no goin tink anodda way. But da bugga dat stay bodda who him. Eh, bruddas an sistas, if I still yet wen teach dat we gotta cut skin, den no goin bodda nobody, cuz den Jesus neva need mahke on top da cross. So if I wen teach lidat, den how come dem buggas make me suffa? Cuz I stay teach dat Jesus wen mahke so peopo can come right wit God. An dat bodda dem buggas. Dem buggas dat stay bodda you guys fo go cut skin, why dey no go chop um all off?! Eh, bruddas an sistas, God wen let you guys go, but dat no mean you can make any kine how you like. Mo betta, kokua each odda, cuz you guys get plenny love an aloha fo each odda. Da Bible say, “Get love an aloha fo da odda guy, jalike you get love fo yoaself.” If you guys do dat, den you goin do everyting Godʼs Rules say. But if you guys go beef wit each odda, an eat up each odda jalike wild animals, den watch out, cuz you guys goin wipe out each odda. But I like tell you guys dis: Stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, an you guys no goin do da kine stuff you like do jus cuz you peopo. Cuz Godʼs Spirit no can take da kine stuff yoa body like do, an da body no can take da kine stuff Godʼs Spirit like do. Dey stay agains each odda. So den, you guys no can do da kine stuff you like do. So, if you guys listen to Godʼs Spirit, den you guys no gotta do wat da Rules say fo get um right wit God. Da bad kine stuff dey like do jus cuz dey peopo stay clear: dey like fool aroun anybody, even anodda guyʼs wife o husban, an do any kine pilau stuff. Dey no shame. Dey go down an pray in front da idol kine gods. Dey put kahuna on top odda peopo. Dey hate odda peopo. Dey like make argue. Dey no like if da odda guy mo importan den dem. Dey get huhu. Dey ony tink bout demself. Dey everytime tink diffren an like split up da bruddas an sistas. Dey like get da odda guyʼs stuffs. Dey everytime get drunk an party up, an all dat kine stuff. I telling you guys, jalike I wen tell you befo time, da peopo dat make lidat, dey no goin get God fo be dea King. But if we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, he we goin get wat we work fo, if we no give give us plenny love an aloha fo everybody. He make us guys stay good inside. He make our hearts rest inside. He help us wait fo da odda guy an stay cool. He help us tink good bout da odda peopo, an like do good kine stuff fo dem. He help us do wat we promise. He help us make nice to peopo an do um wit good kine heart. He help us stay in charge a ourself. No mo rules dat say you no can do all dat kine stuff. Everybody who Jesus Christʼs guy, dey no goin do all da kine bad stuff dey like do jus cuz dey peopo. Jalike dey wen put all dat kine stuff on top da cross wit Jesus Christ, an dat stuff no mo power ova dem. If we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, den we everytime gotta let him stay in charge a us. No get big head. No try make da odda guy beef. No try be mo betta den da odda guy. 1 Eh, bruddas an sistas, if you see some- body doing bad kine stuff, you guys dat stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, you go help Wat da Spirit Do, an Wat da Body Do bring um back. Make nice to dem, an do um wit good kine heart. Tink bout yoaself too, an watch out, so you no goin get presha fo do da same kine stuff. Help da odda guy wen you know dat dey need help. If you do dat, you goin do everyting Christʼs rules say. If one guy tink he hot stuff wen he not, dat guy, he ony bulai himself. Everybody gotta check demself out, fo wat dey do. Den dey can feel good cuz a wat dey do ony. No good dey check himself out wit wat da odda guy do. Cuz everybody gotta do fo demself. But whoeva teach wat God say, da guy he teach suppose to kokua his teacha from da good stuffs da guy get. No bulai yoaself. Nobody goin make fun a God.

But wen one guy work fo da Boss, he not suppose to like make argue, you know. He suppose to be friends wit everybody, an be one good teacha, an no stay huhu at da odda peopo. Wen peopo talk agains him, he gotta teach um da true stuff, but do um nice. Den God can make dem change dea mind, an make dem so dey can know da trut. Den dey can come smart an get outa da trap dey stay in, cuz da Devil wen catch um an make um do wat he like um fo do. Be? Rememba everybody goin presha out.

Some a dem, dey like make good friends wit da peopo inside one ohana. Some wahines, dey bulai dem an take um from dat ohana. Dose wahines no stay kine stuff, an dat bodda dem, but dey no can handle. Dey ony like do any kine how dey like. Dey everytime like listen to any kine teacha, but dey no can figga out wass true. You rememba wat wen happen Egypt side, dat time da Egypt guys Jannes an Jambres wen try fo go agains Moses, but dey no can.

I wen handle all kine presha, you know, an da Boss, he wen take me outa all dat. An you know wat? Everybody dat like live da way God like, an stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus Christ, peopo goin make dem suffa. An da bad kine peopo, an da peopo dat bulai, dey goin ack mo an mo worse. Dey goin bulai peopo, but dey ony bulai dea own self, you know. But you, Timoty, you gotta stick wit da stuff you wen learn, dat you gotta make shua odda peopo know um too. Cuz you know da peopo dat wen teach you all dis, an you know how dey stay. From small kid time, you know awready da tings da peopo from befo time wen write inside Godʼs Spesho Book, da Bible. You know dat dis stuff, can make you come smart fo know how fo live, fo get outa da bad kine stuff. Az why gotta trus Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus Christ, an gotta stay tight wit him. Eh, everyting inside da Bible stay dea, cuz God wen put um inside da guys heads dat wen talk fo him befo time. Dass why everyting inside da Bible, can use um fo teach, an fo show wat stay wrong, an fo help peopo pau do da bad kine stuff an come back an stick wit da good kine stuff, an fo teach peopo fo do wass right. So from dat, da one dat stay all out fo God can get everyting dey need fo do all kine good kine stuff.

Fo all dis, you gotta stick wit dem guys fo long time, an you gotta teach um good. You know, da time goin come, wen peopo no goin listen to da peopo who like teach da solid kine stuff. Dey goin do any kine how dey like. Dass why dey goin bring togedda mo an mo teacha guys, but ony fo teach um da kine stuff dey like hear. Dey no goin listen to da true stuff, an dey goin go da odda way. But dey goin like listen to any kine make up stories dat not true. But you, Timoty, you gotta stay cool head, no matta wat happen.

Bumbye I goin make da peopo dat go agains you Dat you my Boy!” Go down in front you, Fo show dat you da winna ova dem.” 14 Allda angel guys, dey da good spirits dat work fo God. He send um all ova fo help da peopo come outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing, cuz dose peopo his kids. Us guys gotta tink plenny bout all da stuff we wen hear, so dat we no foget um. You know, all da stuff da angel messenja guys wen tell befo time was da trut, an was from God. If had peopo dat wen broke Godʼs Rules an neva listen, God wen do da right ting wen he punish um fo da Rules dey wen broke. Was lidat befo time. But den, da Boss Jesus wen start fo tell peopo dis awesome ting -- how dey can get outa da bad kine stuff! Had peopo dat wen hear him, an dey wen show us guys proof dat da tings he wen say was fo real. But if us guys no like listen him, no way we goin get outa da bad kine stuff. An one nodda ting: God wen show dat da peopo dat wen hear him befo, stay telling da trut, cuz he wen do all kine awesome stuff wit power fo show who him. An God wen give peopo his Good an Spesho Spirit, so dat diffren peopo can do diffren kine tings. Az jalike how God wen like do um. Kine Stuff 41:8-9) 5 We talking bout da new world dass goin come. But God neva tell bout da angel guys, dat dey goin be in charge ova dea. But get one place inside da Bible wea David wen say dis: “God, how come you tink plenny bout us 7 You wen make da angel guys You wen make us peopo awesome [An you wen put us peopo 8 You wen make us boss ova everyting.” You know, wen da Bible say dat God wen make us peopo boss ova everyting, dat mean everyting! But right now, wen us guys look aroun, we can see dat us peopo still yet no stay boss ova everyting. But 2 get one Guy dat “fo litto bit time, da angel God Take Us Guys Outa Da Bad Kine Stuff guys was litto bit mo importan den him.” Dass Jesus! Cuz Jesus wen go suffa an mahke fo everybody, God “wen make him awesome, an show him plenny respeck, jalike God go put one crown on top his head.” Dass how God wen do plenny fo us, cuz Jesus wen go suffa an mahke fo everybody. So, good dat God wen make Jesus suffa. Cuz dat make Jesus da bestes kine Leada fo take plenny peopo outa da bad kine stuff dey do, an fo make um come awesome cuz dey Godʼs kids now. An God da One dat wen do um, cuz everyting az fo him, an everyting stay cuz he wen make um. Jesus make peopo good an spesho fo God. An him an dem, jalike dey all get da same Fadda. Dass why he no mo shame fo call dem “my bruddas an sistas.” 12 Dis wat Jesus wen tell God: “I goin tell all my brudda an sista guys Bout wat kine God you. An wen my bruddas an sistas all come togedda, Jesus, He Da Leada Dat Take Us Outa Da Bad I goin sing bout you.” 13 An again, one nodda place, he say dis: (Songs fo God 8:4-6; 22:22; Isaiah 8:17-18; “I goin trus God everytime.” An one nodda place, he say dis again: “Look! Dis me! An dese guys, dey Godʼs kids! God wen give dem to me!” 14 Now, Godʼs kids get skin an blood cuz dey peopo. Dass why Jesus wen do da same ting fo be jalike dem, wit skin an blood too. He peopo on top da earth? wen do dat so dat wen he mahke, he wen An how come you get aloha fo us hemo all da power from da Devil, da one peopo? dat get power fo kill peopo.

Fo shua Jesus neva come hea fo head. help da angel guys, but fo help da peopo dat come from da Abraham ohana ancesta in charge a everyting you wen make.] guys. Dass why Jesus gotta come jalike his brudda an sista guys, every kine way. An cuz he jalike dem, he goin come dea Head Priest fo take care all da kine stuff da Jewish head priest guy do fo God. He give da peopo chance, an he da kine guy dey can trus. Cuz az who him, he goin hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff da peopo wen do, an bring um back togedda wit God. Jesus, he had presha fo do bad kine stuff, but he neva. Still yet, he wen suffa plenny cuz a dat. Dass why, now he can help da peopo, everytime dey get presha fo do bad kine stuff. Bruddas an sistas, you guys real spesho fo God in da sky. He wen tell all you guys fo come be his guys, an you guys wen come awready. So tink bout Jesus! Us guys like tell all da peopo dat he da Guy dat God wen send fo tell peopo wat God say, an he da Head Priest fo us guys. God wen send Jesus, an Jesus wen do everyting God wen trus him fo do. Jalike Moses wen do everyting God wen trus him fo do wit all Godʼs peopo. Jesus stay mo awesome den Moses. Az jalike da guy dat wen build one house suppose to get mo respeck den da house he build. Every house, you know, get somebody dat wen build um. But God da One wen make everyting. Moses was one worka guy fo God. He wen take care everyting dat God wen trus him fo do wit all Godʼs peopo. Dat wen show da peopo wat God was goin talk bout bumbye. But Christ, he da Faddaʼs Boy, an cuz a dat, he stay in charge a Godʼs peopo. An you know, us guys Godʼs peopo. If we hang in dea, an no mo shame fo come tight wit God, we everytime goin talk bout da good kine stuffs we stay waiting fo God fo do bumbye. Census 20:2-5; 14:21-23) 7 So, jalike Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen say inside da Bible, “Today, wen God tell you guys someting, Jalike yoa ancesta guys wen do Ova dea inside da boonies. Dey even wen try fo push God hard Fo see if he goin bus um.” 9 God wen say, “Yoa ancesta guys wen check me out. Fo find out if I goin bus um. Den fo forty years dey wen see wat I do. Cuz a all dat, dass why I wen had it Wit da peopo dat wen go agains Moses. I wen say, ‘Dem guys get bad kine attitude. Dey everytime go agains me. Dey neva like listen to me.’ 11 Wat dem guys wen do, I no take dat. Godʼs Boy Mo Importan Den Moses So, I wen make one strong promise: (Da Census 12:7) ‘No way dem guys eva goin go inside Da land I wen like give um fo rest!’ ” 12 Eh, bruddas an sistas, watch out! Make shua dat nobody get pilau kine attitude, da kine wea dey no trus God, an da kine attitude wea dey no goin like bodda wit da God dat stay alive fo real kine. Mo betta dis: all you guys go give each odda good kine words. Do dat every day. Cuz now, dass da “Today” God talking bout inside da Bible. Den no goin get nobody wit you guys dat goin come all hard head. Cuz you know, da bad kine stuff goin bulai you guys, an make you guys come hard head. You know, God wen make all us guys stay tight wit Christ. But we gotta hang in dea an stay trussing God all da way, jalike wen we wen trus him da first time. Jalike da Bible wen say, “Today, wen God tell you guys someting, No go come hard head, Jalike yoa ancesta guys wen do, Dat time dey wen go agains Moses.” 16 Who da peopo he talking bout dat wen go agains Moses, afta dey wen hear wat he say? Az was all da peopo dat Moses wen bring outa Egypt. An wen God tell, “Forty years, I wen had it wit dem guys!” who he God Make His Peopo Rest talking bout? Az was da peopo dat wen go (Songs fo God 95:7-11; Outa Egypt 17:7; Da do bad kine stuff, an bumbye dey wen all mahke in da boonies, an dea bodies wen stay dea. Who da peopo God talking bout wen he wen make dis strong promise: “No way dem guys eva goin go inside da land 8 No come hard head, I like give um fo rest”? Az was da peopo dat no like listen him. Now us guys can Dat time dey wen go agains Moses, figga how come dem guys no can “go inside da land God like give um fo rest.” Cuz dey nodda kine day fo get rest. So den, dat neva trus God, dass why. So den, God wen make one promise, dat um. Dat mean time fo rest, an you pau do he get one place dat he like give us fo “go yoa work awready, jalike God wen rest, afta rest inside.” An dat promise still stay solid. he wen pau do his work. So den, watch out dat some a you guys no mess up, an den you guys no goin get da dat kine rest, so dat nobody mess up cuz kine rest God wen promise you guys. Now, dey no trus God, jalike da peopo dat wen we wen hear da Good Stuff From God jalike mess up befo time. Cuz you know, da our ancesta guys.

Now us guys dat trus God, jalike we Goin check out wat we stay tinking, an wat “go inside Godʼs place an rest wit him.” But stay inside our heart, an how come we stay God wen say befo time bout our ancesta doing da kine stuffs we do. Dass jalike one guys: “Wat dem guys wen do, I no take dat! ‘No way dem guys eva goin go inside You know, long time ago, wen God wen tings we wen do. make da world, he wen pau do everyting he goin do inside da world. An still yet, cuz dem guys neva trus him, he neva let um go inside da land. Get one place inside da Bible dat talk bout Day Numba Seven Godʼs Own Boy, an he da bestes kine Head lidis: “Day Numba Seven, az da day God Priest guy. He wen go all da way up inside wen rest, afta he wen pau make everyting.” da sky wea God stay awready! So, all us 5 An in one nodda place inside da Bible, God guys dat say we trus Jesus, we gotta hang in wen say dis: “No way dem guys goin eva go dea an no give up fo trus him.

Cuz he wen get presha fo do all kine Da peopo dat wen hear da Good Kine Stuff bad stuffs jalike us guys. But he neva. So From God befo time, dey neva go inside den, no need be scared. Us guys gotta make dea, cuz dey neva like trus God. One mo strong fo go in front Godʼs throne, cuz he time, God make spesho one nodda day fo like do plenny good kine stuff fo help us. dem. Cuz long time afta our ancesta guys He goin give us chance, an wen we need neva like trus God, David wen write down help, he goin give um. inside da Bible wat God wen say, da same kine tings I jus wen tell you guys. He wen talk bout one time, an dat time, he call um “Today.” He say: “Today, wen God tell you guys someting, 8 David not talking bout da time Joshua wen take da peopo inside da land, you Dis head priest guy, he give dea gifs to God, know. Cuz if Joshua wen give dem rest, an he make sacrifices fo da bad kine stuff den God no need fo talk bumbye bout one dey wen do. Dis kine guy goin make easy mean, get one rest day fo Godʼs peopo still yet, jalike Day Numba Seven, dat time God 4 wen rest. (Songs fo God 95:7-8,11; Da Start 2:2) 10 So, wen God give you his kine rest, take 11 So den, good us guys really like get sharp sword dat can open da joints an da bone marrow stuff. Everyting God wen Dass why I wen make one strong make, he can see. No mo notting dat can promise, hide so dat he no can see um. Cuz everyting stay open fo him check um out. An God, da land I like give dem fo rest!’ ” he da One we gotta tell why we wen do da Jesus Da Bestes Kine Head Priest Guy Hebrews 2:17-18 14 Kay den. Now us guys, we get Jesus. He Priest Guy, Jesus, he undastan how us guys 5 (Songs fo God 2:7; 110:4) 1 Now, weneva dey pick one guy from da Jewish peopo fo come be da head priest Listen good an no come hard head!” guy, dat guy get da job fo help da peopo do da kine stuffs da peopo gotta do fo God. to da peopo dat mess up cuz dey donno wat dey suppose to do. Da head priest guy, same ting jalike da peopo, he not strong too. Dass why he make easy to dem. An dass why he gotta make sacrifice fo himself jalike fo da peopo, cuz he do da bad kine stuff jalike dem. You know, dat head priest guy, he get plenny respeck. But nobody can make himself da head priest guy, cuz dass one spesho job. God gotta be da One fo pick da guy, jalike da first time, he wen pick Aaron. stuff bout how we gotta come sorry fo all 5 Same ting fo Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. He neva make himself awesome fo come da Head Priest guy. But was God dat wen make um come awesome. God wen tell him, “Today I wen tell 6 An get one nodda place inside da Bible dat God talk lidis: “You goin stay one priest foeva, 7 Wen Jesus wen stay hea inside da world, he wen pray real hard, an he wen cry real loud, cuz he know dat God can take him outa dea so he no gotta mahke. An God wen listen to him, cuz Christ all da time show him respeck, an ony do wat God say. No matta Christ Godʼs Boy, wat he wen suffa wen teach him fo listen God. Christ wen come perfeck, an now he da One dat take all da peopo dat listen to him outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing. An he help um stay perfeck lidat foeva. Az why God wen make Jesus da Head Priest guy, jalike da Melkizedek kine priest. Get plenny mo stuffs we like say bout all dis, Christ an da Melkizedek guy. But az not easy fo tell um, cuz you guys no can undastan too good. You know, time awready fo you guys come teachas. But you guys still yet need somebody fo teach you guys one mo time da easy kine stuffs bout wat God wen say. You guys jalike babies dat need milk, cuz you guys no can handle da solid stuff still yet. Wat dat mean, “babies dat need milk”? Anybody dat donno wat God say bout doing da right tings, dey jalike one small baby. An wat dat mean, “handle da solid stuff”? Dat kine stuff fo da grown up peopo. Dose peopo, dey jalike da guys dat stay work out all da time fo come mo strong. Dey stay doing da good kine stuff everytime an not da bad kine stuff. Dass how dey know how fo figga wass good an wass no good. 1 So den, nuff awready fo teach da first kine stuff bout Christ. Now we gotta talk bout how fo come solid an grown up inside. No need teach ova an ova da beginnas kine da bad kine stuff we wen do dat goin cut us off from God, an no do um no moa. No need teach ova an ova dat everybody gotta trus God. No need stay teach everytime bout all kine baptisms, no need teach everytime bout putting da hands on top peopo fo Dat you my Boy!” show you like God do plenny good tings fo dem, no need teach everytime bout how da mahke peopo goin come back alive, no Da Melkizedek kine priest.” need teach everytime bout how everybody gotta stand in front God da Judge, an get wat he say, foeva. So now, we goin leave all da beginnas kine stuff behind, if God let us do um. Den we goin talk bout how fo come solid an grown up inside. Get peopo dat one time wen see Godʼs light an trut from up dea inside da sky. Dey wen start fo take in da good kine stuff God wen give um, an dey wen get Godʼs Spesho Spirit. Dey wen find out how good da stuff God say. Dey wen feel da power from da time wen God stay in charge a everyting. But if dey turn away from Christ, den no way dey can come sorry one mo time fo Watch Out! No Go Da Wrong Way! da bad kine stuff dey do, an come back togedda wit Christ. Cuz den, dey demself, jalike dey wen kill Godʼs Boy on top da cross one mo time, an make him shame in front everybody again. You know, wen da groun take in da wa- ter everytime get rain, an make da plants dat da farma guys grow fo da peopo, an da groun come good fo dem cuz a dat, den God goin make dat groun mo good. But if dat groun grow ony da kine bushes wit kukus an junk stuff, dat land no good! Bumbye God goin say, “Wipe um out an burn um!” 9 But, my good friends! We talk bout peopo dat go da wrong way, jalike dat land dat stay poho. But we stay shua dat mo betta tings goin happen to you guys, cuz God stay taking you guys outa da bad kine stuff. God, he everytime do da right ting, so he no goin foget how plenny you guys wen work fo him, an how you guys wen show him love an aloha cuz you know who him. Cuz you guys wen kokua Godʼs spesho peopo, an still yet you guys stay kokua dem. Same ting, now we like all you guys fo show dat you guys go all out jalike befo time. Den you guys goin hang in dea all da way, an know fo shua dat God goin do everyting he wen promise. We no like you guys ack jalike you guys no like do notting. Mo betta you guys make jalike da peopo dat bumbye goin get all da stuffs God wen promise his kids, cuz dey trus God an stay hang in dea. Tink bout Abraham. Befo time God wen make one promise to him. But no mo odda guy mo big den God. Dass why God neva make one strong promise by some odda guy. He wen make um by himself dat he was really goin do um. Dis wat God wen promise: “Fo shua I goin do plenny good kine stuffs fo you, an I goin give you plenny ohana wit plenny peopo.” 15 So Abraham wen go hang in dea an wait long time, an den he wen get wat God wen promise. Wen peopo make one strong promise, dey make um by somebody mo big den dem, so den everybody know dat dey goin do um. Dat show dey really mean um. An den wen dass all pau, da odda peopo no can make argue. Cuz God like show his kids real clear dat da plan he wen make fo dem no goin change eva, he wen make dat strong promise by himself dat he goin do um himself. Wen God wen do dat, he wen do two tings dat no goin change eva: he wen make one strong promise, an he wen do um himself. An God no bulai notting. He make dat promise cuz he like give us guys plenny good kine words. Dass fo us guys dat stay running to God from da bad kine stuff, so dat we can take da good kine stuff God wen promise he goin give us bumbye. We know he goin do dat, an we goin stay wait fo um. Wen we trus God an we know he goin do good stuff fo us bumbye, dat make us stay strong an solid inside, jalike wen da boat anchor come stuck on da ocean bottom an den da boat no can move. Wen we trus God lidat, den we can come tight wit him, jalike wen da Jewish head priest go inside da Real, Real Spesho Place wea God stay inside. Dass wea Jesus wen go befo us guys, da place wea God stay fo real kine, jalike da head priest guy go inside da Real, Real Spesho Place inside Godʼs temple. Jesus wen do dat fo us, cuz he one head priest foeva, da same kine head priest jalike Melkizedek befo time. Da Melkizedek Kine Priest (Da Start 14:1-20; Songs fo God 110:4) 1-3 Was dat time, dis Melkizedek guy was Wen God Make Promise, He Do Um king fo Salem town, an he was priest fo (Da Start 22:16,17) da Mos Importan God. Now, “Melkizedek,” dat mean, “Da King Who Everytime Do da Right Ting,” an he da King fo Salem, dat mean, “Da King Who Help da Peopo Stay Good Wit Each Odda.” Nobody know who his fadda guys o his mudda guys, o who his ancesta guys. Nobody know wen he wen born o wen he wen mahke. Dat mean he jalike one picha a Godʼs Boy, cuz he stay one priest guy, jalike Jesus stay one priest guy foeva. One time, had some kings an dea army guys dat wen go rip off plenny stuff from da peopo dat live near Abraham. Abraham dem wen go fight an win ova dose kings an dea army guys. Dey wen take back all da stuffs. Den wen Abraham was coming back, Melkizedek wen go out from Salem Town fo meet him. An dass wen Melkizedek wen tell Abraham, “Eh! God goin do plenny good kine tings fo you.” An Abraham, he wen give Melkizedek ten percent a all da stuffs he wen take back, cuz Melkizedek one priest guy. Tink bout dis: Melkizedek was one real importan guy. He was so importan dat our ancesta guy, Abraham, even wen give him da bestes ten percent from all da stuffs he wen take back wen he wen fight da kings. Now, all da Jewish priest guys, dey come from Levi, Abrahamʼs great-grankid. Godʼs Rules say dat dose priest guys get right fo take ten percent from all da stuffs all da odda Jewish peopo get -- dass from dea own Jewish bruddas an sistas, cuz dey all come from Abraham. But Melkizedek, he one priest, no matta he neva have Levi fo his ancesta guy. But still yet, Melkizedek wen get ten percent from all da stuffs Abraham wen bring back. Now Abraham, he da guy dat God wen make promises to, but still yet, Melkizedek wen tell him, “God goin do plenny good kine stuffs fo you.” 7 Now, wen get some- body talk lidat, everybody know he gotta be da mo importan guy dass telling dat kine ting to da guy dass not so importan. Da regula kine priest guys take da ten percent. Dose guys, dey goin mahke bumbye. But Melkizedek, he wen take da ten percent, an da Bible neva tell dat he wen mahke.-10 You can figga lidis: all da Jewish priest guys get da guy Levi fo dea ancesta guy, an dey take da ten percent from da peopo. But da time Melkizedek wen meet Abra- ham an Abraham wen pay da ten percent to Melkizedek, dass almos jalike Abraham wen pay um fo all da Levi peopo an all da Levi priest guys dat neva born yet, same time, cuz Abraham da ancesta fo all dem. Now, da priest guys, dey all wen come from Levi, an Aaron was dea first Head Priest. Da peopo need priest guys fo help da peopo fo do wat da Rules say. But da peopo no can come perfeck jus cuz dey get da Levi kine priest guys. Dass how come dey need one diffren kine priest guy. Dey need da Melkizedek kine, not da Aaron kine 12 An you know, wen dey change da kine priest dey get fo one nodda kine priest, same time dey gotta change da Rules. Now Jesus, he da guy we talking bout. He neva come from da Levi ohana, you know. He come from da Judah ohana, an da Rules neva say dat da guys from dat ohana get da right fo make sacrifice on top da altar. Our Boss Jesus, everybody know dat he come from da Judah ohana. But wen Moses talk bout da guys from da Judah ohana, he neva say notting bout prieses. But da whole ting stay come even mo clear now: Get one nodda kine priest guy wen come. Him, he da Melkizedek kine priest, not da Aaron kine priest. (I talking bout Jesus, you know.) 16 Now da Rules say dat da priest guys gotta come from da Aaron ohana, an Jesus no come from dat ohana. Jesus, he stay one priest guy cuz he get da power fo live to da max foeva, an no mo notting can wipe him out. Da Bible wen say dis bout him befo time: “You goin stay one priest foeva, Jalike Melkizedek.” 18 Dat mean, da Rules from befo time no mo power fo help da peopo. Dass why God wen throw out da old rules. An you know, da Rules neva make nobody come perfeck. Now, God give us someting mo betta. So den, now we stay shua we goin trus him. An cuz a dat we stay tight wit him. Wen da guys from Aaronʼs ohana wen come prieses befo time, God neva make promise notting. But wen God wen give us one mo betta ting, he wen make one strong promise. Was wen Jesus wen come priest, dat God wen make dat strong promise. God wen tell him, “I da Boss. I make dis promise, An I no goin change my mind. ‘You one priest guy foeva.’ ” 22 An cuz God wen make one strong promise to Jesus lidat, garans Jesus da One dat goin make shua us guys goin get one mo betta deal. Befo time had plenny guys dat wen come priest. Dass cuz dey no can stay priest long time. Dey wen all mahke, dass why. But Jesus, he da One dat stay live foeva, an he da kine priest dat stay foeva. Dass why no need one nodda priest guy. Jesus, he no mahke. Everytime he stay dea fo aks God fo help fo da peopo dat come to God cuz a him. An dass how he get da power fo hemo dem good from all da bad tings dey stay in. Jesus, da right kine Head Priest guy fo us: He stay good an spesho fo God. Nobody can poin finga him notting. He stay clean inside. He stay diffren den all da peopo dat stay do da bad kine stuff. An God wen make Anodda Priest, Da Melkizedek Kine him mo importan den everyting inside da world o inside da sky. Dass why Jesus, he not jalike da odda head priest guys. He no need make sacrifice every day jalike dem. Dose guys, first dey gotta make sacrifice fo all da bad tings dey wen do, an den dey make sacrifice fo all da odda peopo. But Jesus, he wen make sacrifice fo da peopo one time ony, wen he wen make himself da sacrifice. Now da Rules say fo make guys come da head priest. An you know, dey come head priest, no matta dey not strong in- side. But awready had da Rules wen God wen make one strong promise fo make his Boy come da Head Priest. Az his Boy, da One dass perfeck foeva. Deal 1 So, all dis stuff I stay telling you guys, dis da main ting: Us guys get da kine Head I goin put my Rules inside dea head. Priest dass perfeck. Dass Jesus. He da One dat wen sit down in da mos importan place, I goin be dea God fo real kine, by da right side a da throne wea God Da Awesome King stay up dea inside da sky. Den dey no need go teach all da guys dat 2 Jesus stay working inside da place dat stay spesho fo God, da real place wea God stay, dat da Boss wen make, not jalike da kine tent da peopo wen make. All da head priest guys, dey wen pick um fo come priest fo give da peopoʼs gifs to God, an fo kill da animals fo make da 12 I goin pity dem an give um chance, sacrifices. Az why Jesus, he gotta bring someting fo give to God too. But you know, if Jesus was hea inside dis world now, he no can be one priest guy, cuz awready get guys dat give da gifs to God, jalike da Jewish Rules say. Dose priest guys, dey work fo God inside one big tent dass ony dat jalike one copy a da real place dat stay wit coming old an no good, dat litto mo gone God inside da sky. Dass why, wen Moses awready. wen tink fo make da big tent, God wen tell him, “Make shua you do everyting jalike da picha I wen show you, wen you was on top da mountain.” 6 But da priest kine stuff dat Jesus stay doing fo God, dat stuff plenny mo betta den da stuff da odda priest guys stay do. An Da1Prieses 24:1-9; Da Census 17:8-10) jalike dat, same ting, Jesus da middle man fo da deal dass plenny mo betta den da first deal. An dat new deal plenny mo betta, cuz God wen make mo betta promises wen he make dat new deal. Now, if no mo trouble wit da first do all dat. Dat place was one big tent, an deal, den no need make one nodda deal. inside da first room da priest guys put da 8 But God wen get plenny hard time wit da stand fo da lamps, an da table wit da Spesho peopo, cuz dey no can handle. Dass why he wen say dis inside da Bible: “Da Boss say, ‘Listen! Da time goin come, Wen I goin make one new deal Fo da Israel ohana, An fo da Judah ohana. No goin be same same jalike da deal Dat I wen make wit dea ancesta guys, Da time I wen take dea hand Fo bring um outa Egypt. Dem guys, dey neva stick wit da deal I wen 8 make wit dem. Cuz a dat, I wen pau listen dem.’ Jesus, Our Head Priest Give Us One Mo Betta Az wat da Boss wen say. (Outa Egypt 25:40; Jeremiah 31:31-34) 10 ‘Dis da deal I goin make bumbye Wit da Israel ohana peopo. I goin write um inside dea heart. An dey goin be my peopo fo real kine. live close, An dey no need go teach dea bruddas an sistas. No need tell um, “Eh! Gotta know da Boss!” Cuz dat time, dey goin all know me, Da small litto guys all da way to da big importan guys. No matta dey wen do tings dat no stay right. An I no goin stay tink bout Da bad kine stuff dey wen do.’ ” 13 Wen God wen say “da new deal,” mean he wen make da first deal no good awready. An you know, wateva stay 9 Godʼs Big Tent Inside Dis World An Godʼs Place Dass Fo Real Inside Da Sky (Outa Egypt 16:33; 25:10-39; 30:1-6; 37:10-16; So wat I telling you guys? Wen God wen make da first deal wit da Jewish peopo, he wen give dem da Rules how fo pray an show him love an respeck. An had one spesho place on top da earth wea dey suppose to Breads fo God on top. Dey call dat room “Da Spesho Place fo God.” 3 Den had one big thick curtain inside, an da odda side dat kine stuff come to us guys awready. Jalike curtain had one nodda room. Dey call dat room “Da Real, Real Spesho Place Fo God.” 4 An had one altar dea wit gold all ova fo burn incense. An had da Box Fo Help Da Peopo Rememba Da Deal Dey Get Wit God. Had gold all ova. Inside da Box had one gold pot wit da manna kine food inside. An had Aaronʼs walking stick dat one time wen grow leaf on top. Plus, had da flat kine stones wea God wen write down da first deal he wen make. On top da Box, had two statue dat look jalike angel kine guys wit dea wings spread ova da Box. Dey stay dea fo show how awesome God stay. An dey stay ova da spesho place wea God hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff da peopo wen do. But we no can talk some mo bout all dat kine stuff right now, you know. Afta dey wen put everyting inside da big tent lidat, da priest guys wen go all da time inside da first room, fo do da tings dey suppose to do dea, cuz dass dea job. But ony da head priest guy can go inside da Real, Real Spesho Room, an he can do dat ony one time every year. Wen he go inside dea, everytime he gotta take blood from one animal dey wen kill fo sacrifice. He give da blood from da sacrifice to God -- fo himself first, an den fo da bad kine stuff Christ wen make, get plenny mo power fo da peopo wen do, wen dey donno dey doing bad kine stuff. Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen give us all dose cut us off from God. An den we goin work tings fo show dat all da time da first tent stay, no way we can go inside da place wea God stay fo real kine. All dat stuff jalike Christ stay da middle man fo da new deal one picha fo teach us guys nowdays. Dat stuff show dat da gifs an animal sacrifices da priest guys give God fo da peopo, all dat kine stuff no mo power fo throw out da shame dat da peopo get inside, da peopo dat like pray to God. Dat stuff dey doing, da bad kine stuff get ova dem, all da time dass ony bout how da peopo can o no can eat an drink stuffs, an all da kine ways dey suppose to wash diffren kine tings. But you know, dass ony rules bout da outside kine stuff dey suppose to do till God make everyting come new. Christ Wen Go Bleed An Mahke Fo Us 11 But Christ wen come awready, fo be da Head Priest. He da One dat make good da priest guys befo time wen do dea work fo God inside one spesho tent, Christ do his work fo God inside one spesho place dass mo importan an mo betta den da odda one. Dat mo betta place, da peopo neva make um, an dat place no come from dis world. Wen Christ wen go inside da Spesho Place fo God, he wen go inside one time ony. He get da right fo go inside dea, cuz was his own blood he wen bring in front God. He neva need da blood from da goats an cows dat dey wen sacrifice, fo go inside. An dass how he wen cut us guys loose foeva from da power dat da bad kine stuff get ova us. Befo time, da head priest guy wen take da blood from da goats an da cows, an da ash from one burn up young cow, an wen sprinkle um on top da peopo dat stay pilau an no can pray wit da odda peopo. Den dose peopo wen come spesho fo God, jalike dey clean so dey can pray wit da odda peopo. Kay den, Godʼs Spesho Spirit dat stay foeva wen help Christ go bleed an mahke fo us. Christ wen give himself to God fo mahke, jalike one priest give God one per- feck animal fo sacrifice dat no mo notting wrong wit um. So den, da kine sacrifice throw out da shame dat we get inside, so we no goin stay doing da bad kine stuff dat fo God, da One dat stay alive fo real kine. Dass wat Christ wen do. An dass why God make wit da peopo. So now, da peopo God wen tell fo come be his guys, dey goin get everyting dat he wen promise fo give his kids foeva. Dass cuz Christ wen go mahke fo cut dem loose from da power dat dey was unda da first deal. You know, wen get one will, dass one kine deal. Gotta show proof dat da guy dat wen make da will wen mahke fo real kine. If da guy dat wen make da will stay alive still yet, dat will stay worth notting. Ony worth plenny afta da guy mahke. Same ting, az why da first deal God wen make befo time, dat deal wen need blood from one animal sacrifice fo make da deal good. Dat time, Moses wen tell all da peopo everyting dat God wen tell dem dey gotta do. Den he make sacrifice from cows an goats, an take da blood wit water, an dark red wool string fo tie togedda oregano branches, an wen sprinkle da blood on top da Book dat tell wat God wen say, an on top all da peopo dea. Moses tell da peopo, “Dis da blood from da sacrifice, fo make solid da new deal dat God making wit you guys now. Dat mean, dat you guys gotta do wat he tell you.” 21 An den same ting, Moses wen sprinkle da blood on top da big tent, an on top every- ting da priest guys use fo make sacrifice to God. Dis wat Godʼs Rules tell: Need blood from da sacrifices fo almos everyting, fo make um come clean fo God. If no mo notting dat bleed an mahke, den God no goin let nobody go o hemo dea shame fo all da bad kine stuff dey wen do. So den, all da tings I stay telling you dey gotta make, every year, dat ony make guys, dey ony was copies a da real tings up da wit God inside da sky. Fo make dose tings come clean fo use, gotta make dose kine sacrifices. But da tings up dea inside da sky dat stay fo real, dey even need mo betta sacrifices still yet. You know, had one place dass spesho fo God dat da peopo wen make, dat was ony one copy a da real ting. But Christ neva go inside dat place dat Dey kill animals cuz dey sorry dey wen do da peopo wen make. He wen go wea God stay fo real kine inside da sky, an now he stay wea God stay, fo help us guys. An Christ neva make himself one sacrifice ova an ova. But da Jewish head priest guy, every year he gotta go inside da Real, Real Spesho Place, an take blood dass not his own. But you know, if Christ had fo do um ova an ova, den he gotta suffa ova an ova, from da time God wen make da world. But no was lidat. Now, end a da world time, he wen come ony dat one time, fo make himself da sacrifice, an throw out all da bad kine stuff foeva. Garans everybody gotta mahke ony one time, an afta dat, dey gotta go in front God da Judge. So Christ wen come one sacrifice ony one time, fo throw out da bad kine stuff plenny peopo wen do. An he goin come back hea one mo time, not fo throw out da bad kine stuff, cuz he wen do dat awready, but he goin come back fo hemo da peopo dat stay waiting fo him, from da bad kine stuff. Christ Make Sacrifice Ony One Time (Song fo God 40:6-8; 110:1; Jeremiah 31:33- 34) 1 Da Rules ony jalike one shadow, dey not even jalike one good picha a da good kine tings dat goin happen bumbye. Da Rules not da real ting. Dass why da Rules no can eva make perfeck da peopo dat like come tight wit God fo go show him love an respeck. No matta dose peopo go make sacrifice every year, jalike da Rules tell. Cuz if da Rules wen make dem perfeck, fo shua dey pau make sacrifice, cuz no need, yeah? Cuz den da peopo dat go show God love an respeck lidat, dey goin come clean inside from dat time, an dey no goin feel shame no mo fo da bad kine stuff dey wen Godʼs Spesho Guy Come One Sacrifice do, yeah? But no was lidat. Da sacrifice um rememba all da bad kine stuff dey wen do. Cuz da blood from da cows an da goats no mo power fo hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff!-6 You know, wen Christ wen come in- side da world, he tell dis: “God, you no like da sacrifices an da gifs dat dey bring. bad kine tings, So dey burn da whole animal fo make sacrifice, But dat no make you stay good inside. Dass why you wen make ready fo me come one man.” 7 Den, dis wat Christ wen say: “Eh, God! I hea! I wen come fo do wat you like, jalike yoa Book tell bout me.” 8 First ting Christ wen say, “You no like sacrifices an gifs dat dey bring Wen dey kill animals Cuz dey sorry dey wen do da bad kine tings, An wen dey burn da whole animal fo make sacrifice, Dat no make you stay good inside.” Wen Christ talk lidat, he talking bout da stuff da peopo doing cuz da Rules say dey suppose to do um. Den Christ wen say, “I hea. I wen come fo do wat you like.” Christ wen throw out da old stuff so da new way fo live can take ova. Jesus Christ wen do wat God like him fo do. He wen come one sacrifice fo us wen he wen bleed an mahke dat one time. Dass how we wen come da peopo dat stay spesho fo God fo real kine, cuz a wat Christ wen do. An one nodda ting, every day all da priest guys go an do dea work fo God. Ova an ova dey make da same kine sacrifices. But you know, dose sacrifices no can get rid a da bad kine stuff, eva. But dis priest I talking bout, Christ, he wen make da sacrifice fo da bad kine stuff dat one time, an den he wen go sit down ova dea by God, on da right side, da place wea da mos importan guy suppose to sit. From dat time Christ stay waiting fo da time wen bumbye God goin make all da peopo dat go agains Christ go down in front him fo show dat Christ wen fight an win ova dem. Christ wen make da sacrifice one time, an dat sacrifice wen make everybody dat stay coming spesho fo God, fo be da peopo dat stay spesho fo God foeva. Godʼs Spesho Spirit tell us da same ting goin come back pretty soon. too. First he say dis: 16 “Da Boss say, ‘Afta dat time, dis da deal I goin make 17 Den he say, “I no goin tink bout 18 An you know, wen God let da peopo go an hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff dey wen do, den no need make odda sacrifice fo dat no moa. Habakkuk 2:3-4; Da Census 15:25-31; Isaiah 26:11,20) 19 So den, my bruddas an sistas, now we stay shua we no need shame fo go any time inside da place dass spesho fo God fo real kine. We get da right fo dat, cuz Jesus wen go bleed an mahke fo us. Befo time, had dis big thick cloth inside da big tent dat wen shut off da Real, Real Spesho Place wea God stay. But now, Jesus wen open up da new way fo us fo go inside wea God stay, cuz Jesus wen go bleed an mahke, an now he stay alive. Us guys get one nodda ting: one big priest dat stay in charge a Godʼs place. So, us guys goin come tight wit God, wit hearts dat like do wass true, an trus God all da way. Cuz Jesus wen make our hearts clean inside, so we know dat all da bad kine stuff inside us, pau awready. Dass jalike he wen sprinkle our hearts, an wash our bodies clean wit clean water. We shua dat God goin do good kine stuff fo us bumbye. So us guys goin go all out an tell everybody dat, an no ack jalike we not shua. Cuz God da One dat wen make promise dat he goin do da good kine stuff fo us, an he everytime do wat he say. An us guys goin tink bout how we goin help each odda fo do all kine good kine stuff an show peopo choken love an aloha. No stop coming togedda fo church, jalike some peopo no come no moa. Mo betta dis: give each odda good kine words, an do um even mo plenny cuz you guys know da Boss Jesus Watch Out! No Make To Godʼs Boy Jalike He Poho 26 But you know, even afta we know da bumbye fo dem guys. true stuff from God, if we go stay doing da I goin put my Rules inside dea heart, bad kine stuff still yet cuz we like, den no An I goin write um inside dea head.’ ” mo sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff we stay do. If we do dat, den no mo notting we can do, but ony stay scared, waiting fo da time wen God da Judge goin Da bad kine stuff dey wen do punish us. Dat time goin get one awesome An da times dey wen broke my Rules.” fire dat goin burn up all da peopo dat go agains God. Befo time, if get one guy dat no like listen da Rules dat Moses wen write down inside da Bible, an two o three guys wen tell da same ting bout da bad kine ting Now We Goin Come Tight Wit God da guy wen do, den gotta kill da guy. No mo (Da Rules Second Time 17:2-17; 32:35-36; odda chance fo him. Kay den. Get peopo dat make to Godʼs Boy jalike he poho, jalike dey walking all ova him. Dey make jalike no mean notting dat Christ wen bleed an mahke cuz he da sacrifice fo dem. Dey even make jalike no matta dass da blood dat God use fo make da new deal solid, an make dem spesho fo God. Dey talk any kine to Godʼs Spesho Spirit dat do plenny good tings fo dem. So den, God goin make plenny mo worse still yet to dem guys den he wen make to da odda peopo dat neva like listen his Rules befo time. Cuz we know da One who wen say dis inside da Bible: “I da One dat goin pay dem back. An one nodda place God wen say dis: “God goin be da Judge fo his peopo.” 31 Eh! Scared, you know, if da God dat stay alive go afta you! But you guys, rememba how was befo undastan dat God ony wen say da ting, an time. Dat time, jalike God wen let you guys dass how he wen make da world, da sky, an see his light an trut, an you guys wen go everyting. He neva make wat we see from trus him. Afta dat, odda peopo wen make da odda tings we see. you guys suffa plenny, but you guys wen go all out fo hang in dea an no give up. Had times da peopo wen talk any kine to you guys in front everybody, an dey wen He wen trus God, an dass how come his make you guys suffa plenny. Odda times da sacrifice was mo betta den da sacrifice his peopo wen make same kine to yoa friends, brudda Cain wen give God. Cuz Abel wen an you guys wen stick wit yoa friends. An trus God, az why God wen tell dat Abel stay wen dey wen throw some a yoa friends get um right wit God, an dat Abel, he wen inside jail, you guys wen feel love an pity give God good kine sacrifice. No matta Abel fo dem. An you guys even wen stay good mahke, he still yet stay talking to us guys, inside no matta peopo wen go rip off yoa cuz he wen trus God. stuffs. Cuz you guys wen know dat time dat you guys da ones dat get da mo betta stuffs, da kine dat stay foeva. Kay den. You guys wen make lidat, Dass why God wen take him away, an he an no scared. So den, stay make lidat, an neva mahke. Cuz God wen take him away, no give up! Cuz God goin give you guys nobody no can find him dat time. But befo plenny good kine stuff, fo no give up. You God wen take him, God wen tell, “Enok, he guys gotta hang in dea. An afta you guys do one good everyting dat God like you guys fo do, den bumbye you guys goin get da stuff he wen dey no can make God stay good inside. Cuz promise. Da Bible wen tell befo time, “You know da One dat goin come? Not afta real long time. My guys, dat get um right wit me, But if dey come scared an lose fight, 39 Us guys not da kine peopo dat stay scared an lose fight. Dose kine peopo goin wipe God, an dat wen show, dat da odda peopo out. But us guys, we da kine peopo dat trus inside da world do da bad kine stuff.

An cuz Moses wen trus God, he wen do jalike God wen say, fo tell da peopo fo make da Passova sacrifice, an sprinkle da sheep blood all aroun dea doors. Den God no let da killa angel guy wipe out da numba one boy inside da houses dat get da blood on top da doors. Da Israel Peopo (Outa Egypt 14:21-31) 29 Da Israel peopo, dey wen trus God. Dass why dey wen walk thru da middle a da Red Sea, cuz was jalike dry land dat time. But wen da Egypt guys wen try fo do da same ting, da water wen wipe um out.

So, wen God wen wipe out da Jericho peopo dat neva like listen to him, he neva wipe her out.:7; 13:2-16:31; 1 Samuel 1:1-25:1; 16:1-1 Kings 2:11; 1 Kings 17:17-24; 2 Kings 4:25-37; Daniel 3:1- promise us, an come jalike we all suppose 30; 6:1-27) Moses 32 So, wat?

Still yet, dey neva get da tings God wen promise Odda Peopo Wen Trus God An He Help Um um. Dass cuz God wen make plan fo do (Da Local Leadas 4:6-5:31; 6:11-8:32; 11:1- someting mo betta. So dem guys togedda wit us guys, goin get da ting God wen to. So den, wat bout us guys? All dose peopo dat wen trus God befo time, jalike dey all wen run one race. An now, jalike dey all stay standing aroun us, watching us run da race, an showing us how fo do um. So we gotta hemo all da stuff dat make us run slow, you know, da bad kine stuff dat jam us all up. We gotta hang in dea an finish da race dat God wen pick fo us. Da whole time us guys running da race, we ony stay looking at one guy, dass Jesus.

He do dat cuz he know dat bumbye he goin stay real good inside. An in da end, he sit down in da mos importan place, by Godʼs throne, on da right side. So tink plenny bout Jesus! How he wen hang in dea an wen put up wit all kine bad stuff from all da bad peopo who wen give him hard time. If you guys tink bout Jesus lidat, den you guys no goin get tired an lose fight. Eh!

So den, throw out all da pilau kine foeva, an he goin mahke too, jalike da wild flower dry up. Da sun go up an come real hot, an make da plant dry up. Den da flower fall down, an da plant no look nice no mo. Same ting fo da rich brudda -- he stay making his money, but still yet, he goin mahke. From James 1:24 who ony like hear, an no like do notting, he jalike one guy dat check out his face inside da mirror. An wen da guy go way, awready he no can rememba wat kine face he get. But everyting God tell his peopo dey gotta do, dass perfeck, cuz dass wat can hemo you from all da bad kine stuff. So den, if you go check out real good da Rules from God, an no foget wat you wen hear, an stay do um, eh! you goin feel real good inside cuz you stay doing um. If one guy figga he everytime do wat God like, but no can hold back his mout, his religion wase time, cuz he ony fooling himself!

Dat kine guy, he no goin let da peopo inside da world make him do bad kine stuff. Odda Peopo Second Time 5:18) 1 Eh, my bruddas an sistas! You guys trus our awesome Boss, Jesus Christ. So, no ony make nice to some peopo, an not to odda peopo, jus cuz you tink dey no look good. Wat if get two guys dat come to yoa church meeting. One guy get one gold ring, an he all dress up.

But you guys all wrong, how you tinking. Eh, my good friends! Listen! Get peopo inside dis world, an odda peopo tink dey notting, jus cuz dey poor peopo. But dass da ones dat God wen pick fo come his peopo, yeah? So dey trus him plenny, jalike dey rich inside. Cuz God da King, an dey jalike his kids. He goin give dem From James 2:17 up wit dat? Same ting, if somebody ony say he trus God, but same time, he no doCuz God goin judge all us teacha guys mo notting, da bugga no trus God fo real kine, he ony mout. But somebody goin say: “You trus God, but I do plenny good tings.” I goin tell dat guy: “Eh! How come you tink lidat? You no can make proof dat you trus God, if you ony talk, but you no stay do good tings. Ony get one way you goin know dat I stay trus God -- wen I stay do good tings! Den you goin know fo shua dat I trus God. I know you believe get ony one God. Good den! But da bad kine spirits believe dat too. Az why dey stay scared an shaking all ova! Wot! You not tinking! If you trus God, but den, you no do good tings, az wase time. I gotta show you, o wat? “Abraham, da ancesta guy dat all us Jewish guys come from, he wen do wat God6 An da mout jalike one fire. Everybody wen tell him, wen he wen put his boy Isaac on top da altar fo make sacrifice to God. Az why God wen say, ‘Dis guy, he get um wrong.

So dis wen happen jalike da 7 Get some peopo dat can make any kine Bible say: ‘Abraham wen trus God, so Godanimal do wat da guy like -- da kine wild wen make Abraham get um right wit him.’ animals, da birds, da lizard, an da animals An God wen tell, ‘Abraham, he my friend.’ 24 Az right, yeah? Now you can see dat not nuff fo ony trus God an no do notting. You gotta go do someting too, if you like God fo say dat you get um right wit him.” 25 Same ting wit Rahab, da kine wahine from befo time dat take money wen she tell our Boss, da Fadda, how good he stay, fool aroun. Wen she wen let da Israel army guys hide her house, she wen tell dem fo go back one diffren way so dey no get kill. She wen do someting right. Az why God wen good bout God, an wit da same mout we go say she get um right wit him. So den, da body, if no mo spirit inside, stay mahke.

If you talk lidat, you ony stay bulai. You not telling da guy show dat he stay agains God fo shua! trut. You guys say you smart, but you guys no get yoa smarts from God in da sky, you get um from dis mess up world. Dat kine smarts no come from Godʼs Spirit, come from yoaself, come from da bad kine spirits. Anybody dat no like odda peopo be mo betta den dem, o get mo betta stuffs den dem, dey goin come wild an goin do all kine real bad stuff. But da peopo dat get da kine smarts from God in da sky, main ting, dea spirit stay all clean inside. An dey cool head. Dey make good to everybody an make friends wit everybody. Dey get pity fo you an give you chance. Everytime dey make good tings happen. Dey no make good ony to dea friends. Dey ony say wat dey mean an no ack.

So den, how come you guys everytime like make argue an fight wit each odda? You know why? Cuz inside you, you like go all out fo get someting, an same time, you like get one nodda ting.

Wen you guys stand in front God da Judge, dat rust goin be jalike one picha fo show everybody how you guys stay pilau inside, an dat goin eat up yoa body jalike da fire. Da world goin pau, you know! But still yet, you guys like stash plenny stuffs fo yoaself! Tink bout da guys dat wen work hard inside yoa fields. You guys was suppose to pay dem fo da work dey wen do, but you guys neva.

You guys party up all da time hea inside dis world, an Boss goin make him get up. If he wen do you guys tink you gotta get ony da bestes kine stuffs fo yoaself. You guys jalike da From James 5:17 den, if you wen do someting bad, go tell each odda wat kine tings you wen do. Pray fo each odda, so dat you goin come good. Da guy dat get um right wit da Boss an do right, wen he pray, he get power an can do plenny. Elijah was jalike us guys. One time, he wen pray real hard an aks God fo hold back da rain. An God wen hear him an wen do um. Dass why neva had rain ova dea fo three an a half years, dat time. Den he wen pray one mo time, an wen rain. An dey wen plant seed, an bumbye, had plant come up outa da groun. Eh, bruddas an sistas! If one a you guys start fo do da wrong ting an go way from wass true, an one nodda guy help him fo come back, an do da right ting, dass good. Rememba dis: if you help anodda guy who wen do someting bad fo come back to God an no do bad kine stuff, you goin save da guy so he no get cut off from God, an God goin hemo all da shame fo da bad kine tings dat guy wen do, an let um go. From James 1:23 12Wen one guy hang in dea, no matta he get presha fo do someting bad, he can Da Letta stay good inside. He goin get da kine life From James dat God wen promise to da peopo dat get love an aloha fo him. Dass jalike God give “Aloha!” him da prize, cuz he wen fight da bad kine stuff, an win! Wen you get presha fo do someting bad, an you tinking, “Eh, I like do dat!” no go say, “God da One making me do kine stuff, an even moa, he no goin make nobody do bad kine stuff. Az our own You Like Know Wat Fo Do? Trus God! fault wen we start fo tink, “Eh, I like do da bad kine stuff!” Cuz da bad tinking pull us all ova. We come jalike da fish dat go afta da bait. Cuz first we tink, “Eh, I like do wahine too, she no can stop da baby wen ready fo come. Same ting, we no can stop doing da bad kine stuff. An dass wat goin cut us off from God. Eh my good friends! No let nobody bulai you guys. Everytime somebody give you someting nice an spesho, all dat come from yoa Fadda up dea inside da sky. He wen make all da lights inside da sky -- da sun, an moon, an stars. But God no change jalike da tings inside da sky. God wen plan dis fo us: He tell us guys wass true. Az how he wen give us his kine life. From all da tings he wen make hea inside da world, he make us guys spesho kine, jalike us da bestes fruits, da kine dat da farma guy pick first fo make present to God. Wen God Talk, You Betta Listen an Do Um!Eh, my good friends! Rememba dis: You guys know dis stuff awready. Weneva Da Poor Peopo an da Rich Peopo you hear somebody talk, everybody gotta listen real good first befo dey talk. Dat way, dey no get all huhu quick time. Cuz wen you come all huhu, dat no help you fo do da right kine stuff God say you suppose to stuff, an da bad kine stuff dat stay all ova da place. No get big head. Mo betta listen to wat God say. He wen put da tings he say inside you guys awready, an dass strong nuff fo take you guys outa da bad kine stuff you stay in. An no ony listen to da tings God say, now. You guys gotta do um!

Everytime, dey da guys dat talk stink bout da awesome guy Christ, no matta you his guys, an den! You know you stay doing da right ting if you do wat God da King say you gotta do. Da Rule inside da Bible say, “You gotta get love an aloha fo da odda guy, jalike you love yoa own self.” 9 But if you make nice to some peopo, an not to oddas, da tings God tell his peopo dey gotta do, show dat you doing wrong, an you stay broke Godʼs Rules. Dis wat I mean: Anybody dat do everyting God tell his peopo dey 2 gotta do, but ony mess up one ting, dey No Make Nice To Some Peopo An Not To still wen broke all Godʼs Rules, you know. Godʼs Rules wen say, “No fool aroun da (Outa Egypt 20:14; Da Prieses 19:18; Da Rules odda guyʼs wife.” An, “No go kill nobody.” So, even if you no go fool aroun, but you go kill somebody, den you still wen broke Godʼs Rules. Wen you talk an wen you do someting, rememba dat da Rule dat God goin use fo check you out, dass da Good Stuff God tell us. An dat same Good Stuff From God goin hemo you from doing all da bad kine stuff. Da guy dat make like one judge fo da odda peopo, an no give um chance, dat guy no goin get chance wen he stand in front God da Judge. But wen you give da odda guy chance, den no need fo God judge you, an dass mo betta. Trus God, an Do Wat He Say 14 Eh, my bruddas an sistas! So, wat?

You guys know dey need all dat kine stuff fo dea body. Wass 308 From James 3:12 you know, not everybody suppose to teach. hard den he goin judge all da odda peopo. All us guys, we all mess up plenny. But if get one guy dat no mess up eva wen he talk, dat guy stay all grown up inside, an he know how fo take charge a himself an no do bad kine stuff. Tink bout da horse. We put da small bit on da bridle inside dea mout, an dass how we make um go wea eva we like. Same ting wit da big kine boats. Even if da boat big, da strong winds inside da ocean make um go all ova, but still yet, ony need one small rudda, an da guy dat drive um make da boat go wea eva he like. Same ting wit yoa mout. Az ony one small ting, but still yet, can talk real big. Jalike wea get plenny trees. Ony need one small spark fo burn um up, you know. get mout, but wit yoa mout you can make one diffren kine world, wea everyting stay make us come bad inside. Cuz wat we say burning you up inside.

Az why da Bible say, “God stay agains da guy Dat get big head. But da guy dat put himself last, An da odda guy befo him, God goin do plenny fo dat guy.” 7 God, he da boss.

No Talk Stink Bout Yoa Brudda an Sista Da World Guys (Proverbs 3:34) 11 My bruddas an sistas, no talk stink bout each odda. If one guy talk stink bout one brudda, an make himself jalike one judge fo his brudda, dass mean same time he stay tell dat da Rules from God no stay good, cuz dey say he no can judge his brudda. He tink he da judge so he can say dat da Rules no good. If you say da Rules no good, den you no goin do wat da Rules say. You ack jalike you know how fo make 310 From James 5:16 cows. You stay eat all day an make yoaself all fat, fo da time dey goin take you guys to da slaughterhouse! You guys, you make trouble wit da judge fo da peopo dat do da right ting everytime, an den you kill um. An dey no fight back. No Talk Big! Hang In Dea an Pray 7 But eh, bruddas an sistas! Hang in dea, till da Boss Jesus come back. Tink bout da farma guys. Dey wait fo dea plant fo come up outa da groun, you know. Dey gotta hang in dea from da time dey put da seed inside da groun, till get da first rain, to da last rain. You guys, same ting. Hang in dea! Stay strong inside! Almos time fo da Boss Jesus fo come back. Eh bruddas an sistas, no grumble agains each odda. Bumbye Jesus da Judge goin check you guys out. He stay 10 Eh bruddas an sistas! Tink bout da guys dat wen talk fo da Boss long time ago. Dey wen suffa plenny, but dey wen hang in dea. So, make jalike dem. You know wat? Wen we tink bout da peopo dat suffa, an 5 den no give up, we say, dey can stay good Trouble fo Da Rich Peopo inside. You rememba da guy Job dat da Bible wen tell bout? He wen suffa plenny, but he neva give up. An bumbye da Boss wen make everyting good. Cuz da Boss feel pity fo us, an give us chance. Main ting, my bruddas an sistas, no go say, “I swear to God fo make promise.” Wen you make promise, no go say “I swear to God by da earth dat I goin do um.” An no go say “I swear to God by da sky” o by any odda ting. Mo betta, ony say “Yeah” wen you mean yeah, an “No” wen you mean no. O if not, bumbye God da Judge goin punish you. Anybody ova dea by you guys get trou- ble? Good dey pray! Anybody feel good inside? Good dey sing to God! Anybody sick? Good dey aks da older church leadas fo come by dem, pray fo dem, an put olive oil on top dem, an use da Boss Jesus name wen dey do all dat, cuz dey his guys. An wen da leada guys pray an trus da Boss, dat goin make da sick guy come good. Da someting bad, da Boss goin let um go fo dat, an hemo da shame from him. So 311 From James 5:20 1 Dis letta from Peter. Jesus Christ wen send me all ova da place fo tell peopo da Good Stuff from him. I stay writing to all you guys dat God wen pick. You guys make house all ova Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, an Bitynia, no matta, you guys not from ova dea. God da Fadda wen pick you guys fo be his guys, cuz he wen know you guys way befo you guys was born. Godʼs Spirit wen make you guys spesho fo him, so you guys can do everyting Jesus Christ tell you guys fo do. Jesus wen mahke fo you guys. Wen you guys do everyting Jesus tell you fo do, dass jalike God sprinkle Jesus blood on top you guys fo show dat you guys stay spesho fo him. I like God do plenny good tings fo you guys, an help you guys hearts fo rest inside. Him 3 I like everybody fo tell how good God our Fadda an his Boy, da Boss Jesus Christ, stay. God, his Fadda, he give us guys plenny chance. Wen Jesus Christ wen mahke, he wen come back alive again. So den, Christ wen make us live new kine life, jalike we wen born one mo time. Dass why we stay trus Christ, cuz we know fo shua he goin take care us bumbye. Jalike one fadda leave stuffs fo his kids wen he mahke, Jesus wen make good tings ready fo us in da sky.

Stay happening lidat, so dat everybody goin see dat you guys trus God fo real. Jalike dey put da gold inside da fire fo wipe out all da junk stuff. Dass jalike why you guys suffa now, fo wipe out da junks you guys get inside, an fo show everybody Da Numba One Letta dat you guys trus God fo real. All dat mo From Peter betta den da gold. Cuz bumbye wen Jesus Christ come back, da peopo goin tell how “Aloha!” awesome he stay, an dey goin get plenny respeck fo him. No matta you guys neva see Jesus, still yet you get love an aloha fo him. You guys still no can see him, but still yet you guys trus him. You guys feel so plenny good inside, you no can tell how awesome you feel. Cuz you guys stay getting da main ting you guys trus God fo: he hemo da bad kine stuff you guys stay in from you guys. Da way God stay hemo da bad kine stuff you guys stay in from you guys, da guys dat wen talk fo God long time ago, dey wen talk bout wat stay happening right now. Dey wen tell bout how God goin do plenny stuff fo you guys. Dem talka guys wen look real good, an check out plenny stuffs, fo find out bout da good ting you guys get. Christʼs Spirit inside dem wen tell um how Christ goin suffa, an afta dat, We Stay Trus God, An Our Hearts Wait Fo all da awesome tings dat goin happen. So dem guys wen go try find out da time an how goin stay wen all dat stuff goin happen. Da Spirit wen show da talka guys dat all dat kine stuff dey talking bout, no goin happen fo dem, but bumbye goin happen fo you guys. An now you guys wen hear bout um, cuz Godʼs Spesho Spirit from da sky wen help odda guys tell you guys da Good Stuff From God. You know, even da angel messenja guys like figga out all dis stuff plenny. God Tell Us Fo Stay Spesho Fo Him (Da Prieses 11:44,45; 19:2; 20:7; Isaiah 40:6-8) 13 So den, get yoaself ready fo tink good bout all dis stuff. Watch out! Make shua yoa head stay strait.

So, you guys gotta be good an spesho too, everytime, jalike him. Cuz da Bible tell wat God say.:15; Songs fo God 34:8; 118:22; Isaiah 8:14; 9:2; He say, “Stay good an spesho inside, cuz I stay good an spesho.” 17 You guys talk to God jalike he yoa Fadda. He da Judge dat check out wat everybody wen do, an he no make like he like one guy mo den anodda. Dass why you guys gotta do everyting hea inside da world wit plenny awesome respeck fo God. You guys know dat Christ wen pay fo cut you guys loose from da bad wase time kine life dat yoa ancesta guys wen leave you. But Christ neva pay fo you guys wit da kine silva o gold money dat goin pau, you know. But he wen pay fo you guys wit his own blood. Dat cost plenny. He wen mahke, jalike one good kine baby sheep dat no mo notting wrong wit um an dey kill fo da sacrifice. Befo God wen make da world, he wen know Christ was goin do all dat. But God neva show Christ to da peopo inside da world till dese last times. An he wen do dat fo you guys. Cuz a wat Christ wen do, you guys can trus God plenny. God wen make Christ come back alive again, an make him come awesome. So now, God da One you guys stay trus, an you stay waiting fo him fo do wat he say. You guys wen do wat stay true, so now you stay all out fo God. Dat make you get real love an aloha fo yoa bruddas an sistas an no ack.

Dass wat God wen say goin happen to dem. Dat goin go on foeva.” 9 But you guys da one God wen pick. You da priest guys fo da King. You guys da peopo dat stay spesho fo God.

But he wen let God da Judge take care dat, cuz he know God do da right ting. Christ, he da One dat wen do da bad kine stuff. We ony stay live fo do da right kine stuff.

He gotta like make friends wit everybody, An learn how fo make good wit dem. Cuz da Boss Up Dea get aloha fo da peopo Dat do tings jalike dey suppose to, An he listen good wen dey pray to him, But da Boss stay agains da peopo dat do da bad kine stuff.” 13 Eh, who goin touch you guys if you guys like do good kine stuff everytime?

(Songs fo God 34:12-16; Isaiah 8:12-13) He wen mahke so dat you guys can know God. But peopo wen kill him, An Godʼs Spirit wen make him come alive again. Cuz a Godʼs Spirit, Christ wen go teach da spirits dat stay inside one place jalike one jail. Dey da peopo dat neva like listen to God long time ago. Dat time, Noah stay making da big boat. God stay waiting fo da peopo fo do wat he say, but dey neva like. Dass why ony da eight peopo inside Noahʼs boat wen come outa da big floods okay. Dat floods one picha, jalike wen you guys get baptize. Dat show dat God stay taking you guys outa da bad kine stuff you doing, cuz Jesus Christ wen come back alive again. Wen dey wen baptize you, dat neva mean you jus bafe fo clean yoa body. Dat mean you aksing God fo clean yoa heart, so you know you doing da right ting. Jesus wen go back inside da sky, an he stay ova dea in da mos importan place, by Godʼs right side.

You know, everybody gotta stand in front him, da guys dat stay alive an da guys dat wen mahke. God goin check out da guys dat stay mahke now, jalike all da odda peopo, how dey wen make wen dey was alive. Dass why Jesus wen teach da Good Kine Stuff From God to dem, so dey can come alive inside fo real kine an do wat God like. Da time wen everyting goin pau goin come pretty soon. So you guys, use yoa head, an watch out how you make, so you can pray good.

If you suffa, no good if you suffa cuz you wen go kill somebody, o cuz you steal someting, o cuz you one crook, o whoeva suffa cuz dey Christʼs guy, dey no need come shame cuz a dat. Mo betta, cuz dey Christʼs guy, dey tell everytime dat God stay awesome. Cuz da time stay awready fo da peopo fo stand in front God da Judge. God goin start wit his own ohana, an he goin check dem out. So den, wat you figga goin hap- pen to da guys dat no like listen to da Good Kine Stuff From God? Jalike da Bible say, “If stay real hard fo da good guys Fo come out okay, Wat goin happen to da guys dat ack like God no matta, Da guys dat stay doing bad kine We Gotta Take Care Wat God Give Us stuff?” 19 So den, wen God let his peopo suffa, dey can trus him fo take care dem, cuz he wen make dem, an he do wat he say everytime.

Dass why God wen make da rain come hard on top dem, an da flood wen wipe um out. But God wen take care Noah, plus seven odda peopo from Noahʼs ohana.

Same time, he know how fo make da peopo dat no like do wass right, stay suffa till dey gotta stand in front God da Judge. An da peopo dat ony like do all da pilau tings dey like do jus cuz dey peopo, God know how fo make dem suffa even moa. Dey like talk stink everybody dat get da right fo tell um wat dey gotta do. Da Teacha Guys Dat Bulai, Dey Doing Bad Kine Stuff Dem teacha guys dat bulai, dey get big an dey no scared fo talk stink bout God an his awesome kine peopo inside da sky.

Dey wen go do jalike da guy Balaam, Beorʼs boy. He was one talka fo God, but he wen like make money so bad, he wen go do tings dat no stay right. Dat time, Balaam wen stay riding on top one donkey. Da donkey, he no can talk. But God wen make da donkey talk jalike one guy! Da donkey wen scold Balaam fo da bad kine stuff he wen do. Da donkey wen try stop him, so he no do da kine crazy stuff he like wat da Boss wen tell dem fo tell you guys do. Dose teacha guys dat bulai, dey jalike one puka wea da water suppose to come out, but no mo water. Dey jalike da low clouds dat da hard wind blow away. God wen make one real dark place fo put dem guys. I mean dis. Dey talk big, but dey no say notting. Dey talk lidat cuz dey like bulai peopo fo do any kine how dey like do an no shame. Get peopo dat wen go da wrong way, but now dey starting fo come back da right way litto bit. Dey da peopo dat dem teacha guys like bulai. Dose buggas, dey promise peopo, “If you listen to us guys, you can go do any kine how you like!” But da teacha guys dat saying dat, dey jalike slaves dat no can hemo demself from da pilau kine stuff dey doing. Wateva take ova you an make you do um, jalike you one slave fo do dat kine stuff, you know. Gotta know our Boss Jesus Christ fo get outa da pilau kine stuff hea inside da world. But if peopo change dea mind, an get all tie up inside da pilau stuff jalike befo time, dat stuff goin take ova dem. Dey goin come mo worse den befo time. No good if you know da right way fo live, an den you change yoa mind, an no do da good an spesho tings God wen tell you fo do. Mo betta fo you, if you neva know da right way first time. But dose teacha guys dat bulai, inside da Proverbs book: “Da dog throw up, an den he go back to um.” An same ting, “Da pig, you clean um up, an den awready Da Time God Wen Make One Donkey Talk he go back lay down inside da mud.” (Numbers 22:21-35) 3 Da Boss Goin Come Back!

Dey goin say, “Eh! Fo real, dat Jesus wen promise you guys he coming back? Den wea he stay? Our ancesta guys, dey mahke long time awready, an still yet, everyting stay da same from wen God wen make da world!” 5 But you know, get one ting dem buggas no like tink bout: Long time ago, wen everyting wen start, God wen talk, an get da sky. Den God wen start wit da water fo make da land an da water diffren kine, an he wen make da land come up outa da water. Wateva God say goin stay. An God wen use water lata on too, wen da big flood wen come an wipe out everybody inside da world. An you know wat goin happen wit da sky an da world dat get nowdays?

He no like nobody get cut off from him. But dat time wen da Boss goin come back, no goin have nobody dat goin know he coming, jalike wen da steala guy go inside yoa house an you donno he coming. Dat time, da sky an da sun an moon an stars up dea inside da sky goin come burning hot an go “Poom!” an den, no mo notting. Same ting, da world an all da tings dat peopo do hea, goin burn up.

An go all out fo let yoa heart stay rest inside. Our Boss, he hang in dea, so he can give you guys chance fo come outa da bad kine stuff you stay in. Paul An Da Lettas He Wen Write Numba 1 From John 1:1 1 From one Guy, “Godʼs Talk,” dass who him. He da One dat can make da peopo come alive inside fo real. You know, me an da odda guys dat was wit Jesus, we wen hear him, see him wit our own eyes, look at him real good, an touch him wit our hands. Da One dat can make everybody come alive inside fo real kine, he wen show up by me an da odda peopo. We wen see him, an now we tell you guys fo shua bout da real kine life he give dat stay to da max foeva. Dat life come from him. He wen stay wit da Fadda, an den show up by us. Us guys wen see an hear all dat, an we telling you guys too, so you guys can stay tight wit us. We all stay tight wit da Fadda an his Boy Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. We write dis stuff to you guys so dat we can stay good inside to da max. God, He Good 5 Dis da stuff Jesus wen tell us, an we tell you guys: God, he good, an wit him fo shua no mo notting bad. He jalike da light, an he no mo dark kine stuff. If we say we stay tight wit God, but still yet do bad kine stuff, you guys one new ting God say you guys dass jalike we stay inside one dark place. We stay bulai, an we no do notting da true way. But if we do good kine stuff, dass jalike we stay inside da light, jalike God stay da real light stay shining awready. inside da light. Den we stay tight wit each odda. You know, Jesus, Godʼs Boy, he wen bleed an mahke, an dass jalike his blood clean us up inside from all da bad kine stuff we wen do. If we say we no do bad kine stuff, we stay bulai to ourself, an we donno wass true. But if we tell God we sorry fo all da bad kine stuff we wen do wrong, we can trus God fo do wat he wen say he goin do, an do da right ting. God goin hemo our shame, an wash us clean inside from all da stuff we do dass not right. If we say we neva do bad kine stuff eva, dass jalike we saying God one bulaia. Den wat he say no stay inside us. Numba 1 From John 2:13 13 I writing to you faddas, I writing to you younga guys, 14 I writing to you kids I writing to you faddas, I writing to you younga guys, 15 No get love fo da bad kine stuff dat eryting, an wat he teach stay true. He no stay inside dis world. If anybody get love fo bulai. So, jalike he wen teach you guys, dis world, den dey no mo love fo da Fadda. stick 16 You know, all da bad kine stuff dat stay inside dis world, da kine da peopo like get Jesus, so dat wen he come back, we no29need real bad ony fo make demself feel good, da be kine stuff dey like look at an get ony fo do da right ting. So you guys know dat demself, an da kine stuff dey get dat let um everybody dat do da right ting, dey Godʼs make big show, all dat no come from da kids. Fadda, but from dis world. Dis world an all da stuff da peopo like get, dat goin all pau. But da guy dat do wat God like him fo do, he goin live fo real kine foeva. My good friends, da last time stay now. Fadda wen show us! He even wen call us You wen hear dat one guy goin come dat go agains Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. You know, get plenny guys awready dat go agains Christ. Dass how we know da last time stay now. Dem guys wen go way from us, but dey neva come from us. If dey wen come from us, den dey wen stay wit us. But dey wen go way, an dat show dat 3 all dem guys neva come from us. But you guys, you wen get power from Godʼs Good An Spesho Spirit, an you guys clean inside. all know wass true. I writing you guys cuz you awready know wass true. You guys Godʼs Rules, cuz wen you do bad kine stuff, know dat if anybody bulai, dass cuz dey no dat mean you no listen to Godʼs Rules. You like you fo know wass true, yeah? Kay den. Who da bulaia guys I talking bout? Anybody dat say dat Jesus not da no do bad kine stuff, eva. Whoeva stay Spesho Guy God Wen Send, dey da bulaia tight wit Christ no stay do bad kine stuff. Numba 1 From John 3:7 Whoeva stay do bad kine stuff, jalike dey neva see Christ o know him fo real kine. My good friends, no let nobody bulai you guys. Whoeva stay do da right kine tings, dey stay right, jalike Christ stay right. Whoeva stay do bad kine stuff, dey da Devilʼs kid, cuz from da first time da Devil stay do bad kine stuff. Dass why Godʼs Boy wen come, fo bus up da bad kine stuff da Devil stay doing. Whoeva Godʼs kids no stay do bad kine stuff, cuz jalike God stay live inside dem now. Dey no stay do bad kine stuff, cuz dey come from God. Dis how we can know who Godʼs kids an who da Devilʼs kids. Whoeva no do da right kine tings, not Godʼs kids. Whoeva no mo love an aloha fo dea brudda an sista, dey not Godʼs kids too. Da ting you wen hear from da first time say dis: We gotta get love an aloha fo each odda. Tink bout da story inside da Bible from befo time. No make like Cain. He wen stick wit da Bad Guy, da Devil, an kill his own brudda. How come he wen kill him? Cuz Cain wen do bad kine tings, an his brudda wen do da right kine tings. My bruddas an sistas, wen da peopo inside dis world hate you guys, no let dat blow yoa mind. Us guys not mahke inside no moa, but we wen come alive inside fo real kine. An how come we know dat? Cuz we get love an aloha fo our bruddas an sistas, az why. Whoeva no mo love an aloha, stay cut off from God, jalike dey stay from God. Dass da same spirit dat stay go mahke inside. Whoeva hate dea brudda an sista, jalike dey one guy dat kill peopo. An you know dat one guy dat kill peopo no mo da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. Dis how we know wat real love stay like: cuz Christ wen give himself fo mahke fo us. So den, we gotta be ready fo do da same kine ting fo our bruddas an sistas. If get somebody dat get plenny stuffs, an dey see dat dea brudda o sista no mo notting, but dey no mo pity fo dem, how dey can say dat dey get love an aloha fo God? No can. My good friends, no can show love wit talk ony, but gotta show da kine love dass fo real, an do good kine tings how we know da Spirit dat tell da trut an fo everybody. We No Need Come Scared In Front God Numba 1 From John 4:7 7 My good friends, we gotta get love an aloha fo each odda, cuz love an aloha come from God. Everybody dat get love an aloha, dey Godʼs kids, an know God. Da guy dat no mo love an aloha donno God, cuz God everytime get love an aloha fo everybody -- dass how he stay. Dis how God wen show us dat he get love an aloha fo us: he wen send his one an ony Boy fo come inside da world, so dat we can come alive inside fo real kine, cuz a him. Dis how da real kine love stay: God wen get love an aloha fo us guys, no matta us guys neva get love an aloha fo him. An he wen send his Boy fo mahke so he can be da sacrifice dat hemo da shame fo all da bad kine stuff we wen do. My good friends, cuz God wen show dat kine love an aloha fo us guys, den us guys gotta show love an aloha fo each odda too. No matta no mo nobody eva wen see God fo real kine -- if we get love an aloha fo bad kine stuff inside da world, an win. Dis each odda, den God stay wit us an his love stay to da max inside all us guys. Dis how we know dat we stay tight wit God an he stay tight wit us, cuz he wen give us his Spirit fo take charge a us. Me an da odda peopo wen see Godʼs Boy, an we tell everybody dat da Fadda wen send him fo take da peopo inside dis world outa da bad kine stuff dey doing. Whoeva say dat Jesus, he Godʼs Boy, God stay tight wit dem, an dey stay tight wit God too. We know an trus dat God get love an aloha fo us guys. Da way God stay, he everytime get love an aloha fo everybody. Whoeva get love an aloha, dey stay tight wit God, an God stay tight wit dem too. I mean dis: wen da same kine love an aloha dat God get, stay to da max inside all us guys, den we no need be scared wen we stand in front God da Judge, cuz inside dis world we jalike Christ awready. No need be scared if get love an aloha. Cuz if da same kine love an aloha dat God get stay plenny, den no goin stay scared. Whoeva stay scared, dey suffa plenny, jalike somebody stay punish dem. Jalike dey not grown up inside, dey still yet jalike one small kid, cuz dey no mo plenny love an aloha. Us guys get love an aloha fo God cuz he wen get love an aloha fo us first. Whoeva say, “I get love an aloha fo God,” but dey Numba 1 From John 5:14 guys get da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. Everytime we aks God fo do da tings he like make happen, we know fo shua dat he hear us. An if we know dat he stay listen fo wateva we aks him, den we know dat we goin get da tings we wen aks him fo do. If you see yoa brudda doing bad kine stuff dat no make da brudda mahke, you gotta aks God fo help um, an God goin give da brudda life. I talking bout da bad kine tings dat peopo do, but dat no make um mahke. Get bad stuff dat make um mahke -- I no say dat you gotta pray bout dat kine. Everyting dat stay wrong, dass bad kine stuff. An get bad kine stuff dat no make da guy mahke dat do um. We know dat everybody dat stay Godʼs kid no stay doing bad kine stuff, cuz Godʼs Boy take care him, an da Bad Guy, da Devil, no can hurt him. Us guys know dat we come from God, but da Bad Guy stay in charge a all da odda peopo inside da whole world. We know dat Godʼs Boy wen come an help us fo undastan, so dat we can know da One dass God fo real kine. Us guys stay tight wit da One dass God fo real kine -- wit Godʼs Boy Jesus, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. Dass da real God, an dass da real kine life dat stay to da max foeva. Eh you guys! You jalike my own kids! So, stay away from da idol kine gods. Numba 2 From John 1 1 Sista, I da older leada fo da church peopo, an I write you an yoa kids dis letta. I get plenny love an aloha fo you guys fo real kine. God wen pick you guys. Everybody dat know wass true get love an aloha fo you guys, not ony me, 2 cuz da trut stay inside all us guys an goin stay wit us foeva. I like God da Fadda an his Boy Jesus Christ do plenny good tings fo us guys, an give us chance, an make our hearts rest inside. God tell us wass true an he get love an aloha fo us. I wen feel real good inside cuz I wen find out dat get some a yoa kids dat stay stick wit da trut, jalike God da Fadda wen tell us fo do. So now, I tell you, sista, all us guys gotta get love an aloha fo each odda. Dis not one new ting I stay write you dat you gotta do. Dis da ting God wen tell us guys from da start. Dis how we show dat we get love an aloha, we do wat God wen tell us fo do. Dis wat he wen tell us, you guys gotta do all da tings he wen tell us fo do, jalike you guys wen hear from da start. You know, get plenny peopo dat go all ova da world dat try fo bulai us guys. Dat kine guys no like tell dat Jesus Christ wen come one real guy jalike us. Dey go agains Jesus, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. Watch out dat you guys no lose da stuff you guys wen work hard fo. Mo betta, make shua you guys goin get all da good stuff God like give you guys. Whoeva no stick wit da stuff we teach bout Christ, but go teach odda kine stuff, dey donno God fo real kine. Whoeva stick wit da stuff we teach, dey know da Fadda an da Faddaʼs Boy too. If any guy come by you, an he no stay tell da same kine stuff we teach, no tell him fo come yoa house, an no tell him “Aloha.” 11 Cuz da guy dat tell him “Aloha,” he stay doing da same kine bad stuff dat da bulaia guy stay doing. Numba 3 From John 1 1 Gaius, my good friend, I da older leada fo da church guys hea, an I writing to you. I get plenny love an aloha fo you, fo real kine. My friend, I stay aks God fo make everyting stay good fo you, an yoa body stay good too, jalike yoa spirit stay good. Wen da bruddas wen come tell me dat you stay stick wit da trut, an you still stay doing da true kine tings, all dat wen make me stay real good inside. Dis da ting dat make me stay good inside to da max: wen I hear dat my kids stay doing da true kine tings. My good friend, everytime you do stuff fo help da bruddas an sistas, dat show everybody can trus you fo do wat God like. No matta you neva know dem befo, you wen help um. Da bruddas an sistas dat wen go yoa place, dey wen tell da church peopo dat come togedda ova hea dat you get plenny love an aloha. Help dem wit wateva dey need, da way God like you fo do. Dey wen go by you guys fo teach bout Christ cuz dey his guys, an dey neva let da peopo dat donno God help dem. Dass why we gotta take in dat kine peopo an help dem, so we can work togedda wit dem fo wass true. I wen write one letta to da church peopo dat come togedda ova dea, but da guy Diotrefes like be da boss, an he no like listen to me an my friends. So if I come dea, I goin rememba wat he wen do. He talk stupid an bad kine bout us. An dass not nuff fo him. He no take in da bruddas an sistas wen dey come dea. He no let da local guys take um in, an he throw dem local guys outa da church. My friend, no make like da peopo dat do bad kine stuff, but make like da peopo dat do good kine stuff. Da peopo dat do good kine stuff come from God. Da peopo dat do bad kine stuff donno God fo real kine. From Jude 1 1 Aloha! Dis me, Jude. I James brudda, you know. An I one worka fo Jesus Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send.

Da Bible wen say, dat kine peopo goin get punish. I figga lidis: I know you guys know all dat stuff awready, but I like make you guys tink bout da time da Boss wen take da peopo outa Egypt so dey no gotta go back eva, den afta dat, he wen wipe out da peopo dat neva trus him. Same ting wit some angel messenja guys, da one dat neva like stick wit da kuleana dat God wen give um. God wen give um dea own place fo stay, but dey wen bag. Now dey all tie up wit chains foeva. An dey down dea inside da Deep Dark Hole. Den wen da big day come, God goin judge dem. An same ting wit da From Jude 15 15 He da Judge.
